  Abstract                 = {Gaussian graphical models are often used to infer gene networks based on microarray expression data. Many scientists, however, have begun using high-throughput sequencing technologies to measure gene expression. As the resulting high-dimensional count data consists of counts of sequencing reads for each gene, Gaussian graphical models are not optimal for modeling gene networks based on this discrete data. We develop a novel method for estimating high-dimensional Poisson graphical models, the Log-Linear Graphical Model, allowing us to infer networks based on high-throughput sequencing data. Our model assumes a pair-wise Markov property: conditional on all other variables, each variable is Poisson. We estimate our model locally via neighborhood selection by fitting 1-norm penalized log-linear models. Additionally, we develop a fast parallel algorithm, an approach we call the Poisson Graphical Lasso, permitting us to fit our graphical model to high-dimensional genomic data sets. In simulations, we illustrate the effectiveness of our methods for recovering network structure from count data. A case study on breast cancer microRNAs, a novel application of graphical models, finds known regulators of breast cancer genes and discovers novel microRNA clusters and hubs that are targets for future research.},

At the core of this framework is a result that characterizes the exact distribution of linear functions of the response $y$, conditional on the model being selected (``condition on selection" framework). This allows us to construct valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for regression coefficients that account for the selection procedure. In contrast to recent work in high-dimensional statistics, our results are exact (non-asymptotic) and require no eigenvalue-like assumptions on the design matrix $X$. Furthermore, the computational cost of marginal regression, constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis testing is negligible compared to the cost of linear regression, thus making our methods particularly suitable for extremely large datasets. Although we focus on marginal screening to illustrate the applicability of the condition on selection framework, this framework is much more broadly applicable. We show how to apply the proposed framework to several other selection procedures including orthogonal matching pursuit, non-negative least squares, and marginal screening+Lasso.},

  abstract =       {We proposed a general Principal Orthogonal complEment Thresholding (POET) framework for large-scale covariance matrix estimation based on an approximate factor model. A set of high level sufficient conditions for the procedure to achieve optimal rates of convergence under different matrix norms were brought up to better understand how POET works. Such a framework allows us to recover the results for sub-Gaussian in a more transparent way that only depends on the concentration properties of the sample covariance matrix. As a new theoretical contribution, for the first time, such a framework allows us to exploit conditional sparsity covariance structure for the heavy-tailed data. In particular, for the elliptical data, we proposed a robust estimator based on marginal and multivariate Kendall's tau to satisfy these conditions. In addition, conditional graphical model was also studied under the same framework. The technical tools developed in this paper are of general interest to high dimensional principal component analysis. Thorough numerical results were also provided to back up the developed theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We derive an exact p-value for testing a global null hypothesis in a general adaptive regression problem. The general approach uses the Kac-Rice formula, as described in (Adler & Taylor 2007). The resulting formula is exact in finite samples, requiring only Gaussianity of the errors. We apply the formula to the lasso, group lasso, and principal components and matrix completion problems. In the case of the lasso, the new test relates closely to the recently proposed covariance test of Lockhart et al. (2013).},

We also establish a non-asymptotic lower bound that applies to all methods, regardless of their computational complexity. Combined, these results show that the compressive binary search is within a double logarithmic factor of the optimal performance.},

The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating multi-attribute graphs. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features.  Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a simple modification to the recently proposed compressive binary search. The modification removes an unnecessary and suboptimal factor of log log n from the SNR requirement, making the procedure optimal (up to a small constant). Simulations show that the new procedure performs significantly better in practice as well. We also contrast this problem with the more well known problem of noisy binary search.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper gives a precise characterization of the fundamental limits of adaptive sensing for diverse estimation and testing problems concerning sparse signals. We consider in particular the setting introduced in Haupt, Castro and Nowak (2011) and show necessary conditions on the minimum signal magnitude for both detection and estimation: if $x\in\R^n$ is a sparse vector with $s$ non-zero components then it can be reliably detected in noise provided the magnitude of the non-zero components exceeds $\sqrt{2/s}$. Furthermore, the signal support can be exactly identified provided the minimum magnitude exceeds $\sqrt{2\log s}$. Notably there is no dependence on $n$, the extrinsic signal dimension. These results show that the adaptive sensing methodologies proposed previously in the literature are essentially optimal, and cannot be substantially improved. In addition these results provide further insights on the limits of adaptive compressive sensing.},

In this paper, we aim to provide a complementary set of results, in particular by showing that after normalization, the risk of the empirical minimizer concentrates on a single point. Such results have been established by~\cite{chatterjee2014new} for constrained estimators in the normal sequence model. We first generalize and sharpen this result to regularized least squares with convex penalties, making use of a "direct" argument based on Borell's theorem. We then study generalizations to other loss functions, including the negative log-likelihood for exponential families combined with a strictly convex regularization penalty. The results in this general setting are based on more "indirect" arguments as well as on concentration inequalities for maxima of empirical processes.},

  abstract =       {Confidence sets play a fundamental role in statistical inference. In this paper, we consider confidence intervals for high dimensional linear regression with random design. We first establish the convergence rates of the minimax expected length for confidence intervals in the oracle setting where the sparsity parameter is given. The focus is then on the problem of adaptation to sparsity for the construction of confidence intervals. Ideally, an adaptive confidence interval should have its length automatically adjusted to the sparsity of the unknown regression vector, while maintaining a prespecified coverage probability. It is shown that such a goal is in general not attainable, except when the sparsity parameter is restricted to a small region over which the confidence intervals have the optimal length of the usual parametric rate. It is further demonstrated that the lack of adaptivity is not due to the conservativeness of the minimax framework, but is fundamentally caused by the difficulty of learning the bias accurately.},

  abstract =       {We develop adaptive estimation and inference methods for high-dimensional Gaussian copula regression that achieve the same performance without the knowledge of the marginal transformations as that for high-dimensional linear regression. Using a Kendall's tau based covariance matrix estimator, an $\ell_1$ regularized estimator is proposed and a corresponding de-biased estimator is developed for the construction of the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Theoretical properties of the procedures are studied and the proposed estimation and inference methods are shown to be adaptive to the unknown monotone marginal transformations. Prediction of the response for a given value of the covariates is also considered. The procedures are easy to implement and perform well numerically. The methods are also applied to analyze the Communities and Crime Unnormalized Data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.},

On the other hand, memory/space (rather than time) complexity is the main constraint in many applications, and randomized subsampling techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. In this paper we ask whether early stopping and subsampling ideas can be combined in a fruitful way. We consider the question in a least squares regression setting and propose a form of randomized iterative regularization based on early stopping and subsampling. In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis.},

Our main results establish nonasymptotic deviation bounds on the estimation error, sparsity bounds, and model selection consistency for a penalized least squares estimator under concave regularization. The proofs rely on interpreting the graphical model as a recursive linear structural equation model, which reduces the estimation problem to a series of tractable neighbourhood regressions and allows us to avoid making any assumptions regarding faithfulness. In doing so, we provide some novel techniques for handling general nonidentifiable and nonconvex problems. These techniques are used to guarantee uniform control over a superexponential number of neighbourhood regression problems by exploiting various notions of monotonicity among them. Our results apply to a wide variety of practical situations that allow for arbitrary nondegenerate covariance structures as well as many popular regularizers including the MCP, SCAD, $\ell_{0}$ and $\ell_{1}$.},

Among other things, our results indicate that without similarity between the local objective functions (due to statistical data similarity or otherwise) many communication rounds may be required, even if the machines have unbounded computational power.},

In a unified likelihood based framework, we propose new test statistics and point estimators obtained by aggregating various statistics from $k$ subsamples of size $n/k$, where $n$ is the sample size. In both low dimensional and high dimensional settings, we address the important question of how to choose $k$ as $n$ grows large, providing a theoretical upper bound on $k$ such that the information loss due to the divide and conquer algorithm is negligible. In other words, the resulting estimators have the same inferential efficiencies and estimation rates as a practically infeasible oracle with access to the full sample. Thorough numerical results are provided to back up the theory.},

  abstract =       {We propose Quantile Graphical Models (QGMs) to characterize predictive and conditional independence relationships within a set of random variables of interest. This framework is intended to quantify the dependence in non-Gaussian settings which are ubiquitous in many econometric applications. We consider two distinct QGMs. First, Condition Independence QGMs characterize conditional independence at each quantile index revealing the distributional dependence structure. Second, Predictive QGMs characterize the best linear predictor under asymmetric loss functions. Under Gaussianity these notions essentially coincide but non-Gaussian settings lead us to different models as prediction and conditional independence are fundamentally different properties. Combined the models complement the methods based on normal and nonparanormal distributions that study mean predictability and use covariance and precision matrices for conditional independence. We also propose estimators for each QGMs. The estimators are based on high-dimension techniques including (a continuum of) $\ell_{1}$-penalized quantile regressions and low biased equations, which allows us to handle the potentially large number of variables. We build upon recent results to obtain valid choice of the penalty parameters and rates of convergence. These results are derived without any assumptions on the separation from zero and are uniformly valid across a wide-range of models. With the additional assumptions that the coefficients are well-separated from zero, we can consistently estimate the graph associated with the dependence structure by hard thresholding the proposed estimators. Further we show how QGM can be used in measuring systemic risk contributions and the impact of downside movement in the market on the dependence structure of assets' return.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work we consider series estimators for the conditional mean in light of three new ingredients: (i) sharp LLNs for matrices derived from the non-commutative Khinchin inequalities, (ii) bounds on the Lebesgue constant that controls the ratio between the $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{2}$-norms, and (iii) maximal inequalities with data-dependent bounds for processes whose entropy integrals diverge at some rate. These technical tools allow us to contribute to the series literature, specifically the seminal work of Newey (1995), as follows. First, we weaken considerably the condition on the number $k$ of approximating functions used in series estimation from the typical $k^2/n \to 0$ to $k/n \to 0$, up to log factors, which was available only for splines before. Second, under the same weak conditions we derive $L^{2}$ rates and pointwise central limit theorems results when the approximation error vanishes. Under a incorrectly specified model, i.e. when the approximation error does not vanish, analogous results are also shown. Third, under stronger conditions we derive uniform rates and functional central limit theorems that holds if the approximation error vanishes or not. That is, we derive the strong approximation for the entire estimate of the non-parametric function. Finally, we derive uniform rates and inference results for linear functionals of interest of the conditional expectation function such as its partial derivative or conditional average partial derivative.},

This allows us to cover settings with functional response data where each of the $\tilde p$ parameters is a function. The procedure is based on the construction of score functions that satisfy certain orthogonality condition. The proposed simultaneous confidence bands rely on uniform central limit theorems for high-dimensional vectors (and not on Donsker arguments as we allow for $\tilde p \gg n$). To construct the bands, we employ a multiplier bootstrap procedure which is computationally efficient as it only involves resampling the estimated score functions (and does not require resolving the high-dimensional optimization problems). We formally apply the general theory to inference on regression coefficient process in the distribution regression model with a logistic link, where two implementations are analyzed in detail. Simulations and an application to real data are provided to help illustrate the applicability of the results.},

We consider high-dimensional models where the number of regressors potentially exceeds the sample size but a subset of them suffice to construct a reasonable approximation of the unknown quantile regression function in the model. The proposed methods are protected against moderate model selection mistakes, which are often inevitable in the approximately sparse model considered here. The methods construct (implicitly or explicitly) an optimal instrument as a residual from a density-weighted projection of the regressor of interest on other regressors. Under regularity conditions, the proposed estimators of the quantile regression coefficient are asymptotically root-$n$ normal, with variance equal to the semi-parametric efficiency bound of the partially linear quantile regression model. In addition, the performance of the technique is illustrated through Monte-carlo experiments and an empirical example, dealing with risk factors in childhood malnutrition. The numerical results confirm the theoretical findings that the proposed methods should outperform the naive post-model selection methods in non-parametric settings. Moreover, the empirical results demonstrate soundness of the proposed methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of finding large average submatrices of a real-valued matrix arises in the exploratory analysis of data from a variety of disciplines, ranging from genomics to social sciences. In this paper we provide a detailed asymptotic analysis of large average submatrices of an $n \times n$ Gaussian random matrix. The first part of the paper addresses global maxima. For fixed $k$ we identify the average and the joint distribution of the $k \times k$ submatrix having largest average value. As a dual result, we establish that the size of the largest square sub-matrix with average bigger than a fixed positive constant is, with high probability, equal to one of two consecutive integers that depend on the threshold and the matrix dimension $n$. The second part of the paper addresses local maxima. Specifically we consider submatrices with dominant row and column sums that arise as the local optima of iterative search procedures for large average submatrices. For fixed $k$, we identify the limiting average value and joint distribution of a $k \times k$ submatrix conditioned to be a local maxima. In order to understand the density of such local optima and explain the quick convergence of such iterative procedures, we analyze the number $L_n(k)$ of local maxima, beginning with exact asymptotic expressions for the mean and fluctuation behavior of $L_n(k)$. For fixed $k$, the mean of $L_{n}(k)$ is $\Theta(n^{k}/(\log{n})^{(k-1)/2})$ while the standard deviation is $\Theta(n^{2k^2/(k+1)}/(\log{n})^{k^2/(k+1)})$. Our principal result is a Gaussian central limit theorem for $L_n(k)$ that is based on a new variant of Stein's method.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider subagging for non-smooth estimation and model selection in sparse linear regression settings. Proposed weighted maximum-contrast subagging scales with datasets of arbitrary size, yet manages to achieve excellent support recovery. This makes it particularly relevant for computation over complete datasets of extremely large scale, where using traditional methods might be impractical. We develop theory in support of the claim that proposed method has tight error control over both false positives and false negatives, regardless of the size of dataset. Unlike existing methods, it allows for oracle-like properties, even in cases of non-oracle-like properties of aggregated estimators. Moreover, we show limitations of traditional subagging in cases where subsamples are of much smaller order relative to the size of original data. In such situations, it results in discontinuous estimated support set and never recovers sparsity set when at least one of aggregated estimators has probability of support recovery strictly less than 1. Furthermore, we design an adaptive procedure for selecting tuning parameters and optimal weighting scheme. It simultaneously alleviates overall computational burden and relaxes eigenvalue conditions on the design matrix. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulation study and analysis of a part of million-song-challenge dataset.},

In the distributed sparse Gaussian mean estimation problem, each of the $m$ machines receives $n$ data points from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\theta$ which is promised to be $k$-sparse. The machines communicate by message passing and aim to estimate the mean $\theta$. We provide a tight (up to logarithmic factors) tradeoff between the estimation error and the number of bits communicated between the machines. This directly leads to a lower bound for the distributed \textit{sparse linear regression} problem: to achieve the statistical minimax error, the total communication is at least $\Omega(\min\{n,d\}m)$, where $n$ is the number of observations that each machine receives and $d$ is the ambient dimension. These lower results improve upon [Sha14,SD'14] by allowing multi-round iterative communication model. We also give the first optimal simultaneous protocol in the dense case for mean estimation. As our main technique, we prove a \textit{distributed data processing inequality}, as a generalization of usual data processing inequalities, which might be of independent interest and useful for other problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We observe a $N\times M$ matrix of independent, identically distributed Gaussian random variables which are centered except for elements of some submatrix of size $n\times m$ where the mean is larger than some $a>0$. The submatrix is sparse in the sense that $n/N$ and $m/M$ tend to 0, whereas $n,\, m, \, N$ and $M$ tend to infinity. We consider the problem of selecting the random variables with significantly large mean values. We give sufficient conditions on $a$ as a function of $n,\, m,\,N$ and $M$ and construct a uniformly consistent procedure in order to do sharp variable selection. We also prove the minimax lower bounds under necessary conditions which are complementary to the previous conditions. The critical values $a^*$ separating the necessary and sufficient conditions are sharp (we show exact constants). We note a gap between the critical values $a^*$ for selection of variables and that of detecting that such a submatrix exists given by Butucea and Ingster (2012). When $a^*$ is in this gap, consistent detection is possible but no consistent selector of the corresponding variables can be found.},

In this paper, we establish sharp Cram\'er type moderate deviation theorems for Studentized two-sample $U$-statistics in a general framework, including the two-sample $t$-statistic and Studentized Mann-Whitney test statistic as prototypical examples. In particular, a refined moderate deviation theorem with second-order accuracy is established for the two-sample $t$-statistic. These results extend the applicability of the existing statistical methodologies from the one-sample $t$-statistic to more general nonlinear statistics. Applications to two-sample large-scale multiple testing problems with false discovery rate control and the regularized bootstrap method are also discussed.},

The proposed simulation-based testing procedures employ maximum-type statistics and use the Gaussian approximation techniques to obtain corresponding critical values. Different from peer tests that heavily rely on the structural conditions on the unknown covariance matrices, the proposed tests allow very general forms of the covariance structures of data and therefore enjoy wide scope of applicability in practice. To enhance powers of the tests against sparse alternatives, we further propose two-step procedures with a preliminary feature screening step. Theoretical properties of the proposed tests are investigated. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic datasets and empirical applications on identifying diseases-associated gene-sets are provided to support the theoretical results. The proposed tests are easily implemented and computationally efficient in practice.},

  abstract =       {Recent advancements in genomic study and clinical research have drew growing attention to understanding how relationships among genes, such as dependencies or co-regulations, vary between different biological states. Complex and unknown dependency among genes, along with the large number of measurements, imposes methodological challenge in studying genes relationships between different states. Starting from an interrelated problem, we propose a bootstrap procedure for testing the equality of two unspecified covariance matrices in high dimensions, which turns out to be an important tool in understanding the change of gene relationships between states. The two-sample bootstrap test takes maximum advantage of the dependence structures given the data, and gives rise to powerful tests with desirable size in finite samples. The theoretical and numerical studies show that the bootstrap test is powerful against sparse alternatives and more importantly, it is robust against highly correlated and nonparametric sampling distributions. Encouraged by the wide applicability of the proposed bootstrap test, we design a gene clustering algorithm to understand gene clustering structures. We apply the bootstrap test and gene clustering algorithm to the analysis of a human asthma dataset, for which some interesting biological implications are discussed.},

  abstract =       {In this paper, we establish the convergence of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and block coordinate descent (BCD) for large-scale nonseparable minimization models with quadratic coupling terms. The novel convergence results presented in this paper answer several open questions that have been the subject of considerable discussion. We firstly extend the 2-block ADMM to linearly constrained convex optimization with a coupled quadratic objective function, an area where theoretical understanding is currently lacking, and prove that the sequence generated by the ADMM converges in point-wise manner to a primal-dual solution pair. Moreover, we apply randomly permuted ADMM (RPADMM) to nonseparable multi-block convex optimization, and prove its expected convergence for a class of nonseparable quadratic programming problems. When the linear constraint vanishes, the 2-block ADMM and RPADMM reduce to the 2-block cyclic BCD method and randomly permuted BCD (RPBCD). Our study provides the first iterate convergence result for 2-block cyclic BCD without assuming the boundedness of the iterates. Under the same setting, the sublinear convergence rate of the function values can also be verified. We also theoretically establish the expected iterate convergence result concerning multi-block RPBCD for convex quadratic optimization. In addition, we demonstrate that RPBCD may have a worse convergence rate than cyclic BCD for 2-block convex quadratic minimization problems. Although the results on RPADMM and RPBCD are restricted to quadratic minimization models, they provide some interesting insights: 1) random permutation makes ADMM and BCD more robust for multi-block convex minimization problems; 2) cyclic BCD may outperform RPBCD for "nice" problems, and therefore RPBCD should be applied with caution when solving general convex optimization problems.},

In smoothing spline setup, we observe a phase transition phenomenon for the number of deployed machines that ends up being a simple proxy for computing cost. Specifically, a sharp upper bound for the number of machines is established: when the number is below this bound, statistical optimality (in terms of nonparametric estimation or testing) is achievable; otherwise, statistical optimality becomes impossible. These sharp bounds capture intrinsic computational limits of divide-and-conquer method, which turn out to be fully determined by the smoothness of the regression function. As a side remark, we argue that sample spitting may be viewed as a new form of regularization, playing a similar role as smoothing parameter.},

  Abstract                 = {While graphical models for continuous data (Gaussian graphical models) and discrete data (Ising models) have been extensively studied, there is little work on graphical models linking both continuous and discrete variables (mixed data), which are common in many scientific applications. We propose a novel graphical model for mixed data, which is simple enough to be suitable for high-dimensional data, yet flexible enough to represent all possible graph structures. We develop a computationally efficient regression-based algorithm for fitting the model by focusing on the conditional log-likelihood of each variable given the rest. The parameters have a natural group structure, and sparsity in the fitted graph is attained by incorporating a group lasso penalty, approximated by a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through an extensive simulation study and apply it to a music annotation data set (CAL500), obtaining a sparse and interpretable graphical model relating the continuous features of the audio signal to categorical variables such as genre, emotions, and usage associated with particular songs. While we focus on binary discrete variables, we also show that the proposed methodology can be easily extended to general discrete variables.},

However, additional covariates are frequently recorded together with the binary data, and may influence the dependence relationships. Motivated by such a dataset on genomic instability collected from tumor samples of several types, we propose a sparse covariate dependent Ising model to study both the conditional dependency within the binary data and its relationship with the additional covariates. This results in subject-specific Ising models, where the subject's covariates influence the strength of association between the genes. As in all exploratory data analysis, interpretability of results is important, and we use L1 penalties to induce sparsity in the fitted graphs and in the number of selected covariates. Two algorithms to fit the model are proposed and compared on a set of simulated data, and asymptotic results are established. The results on the tumor dataset and their biological significance are discussed in detail.},

  abstract =       {We derive strong approximations to the supremum of the non-centered empirical process indexed by a possibly unbounded VC-type class of functions by the suprema of the Gaussian and bootstrap processes. The bounds of these approximations are non-asymptotic, which allows us to work with classes of functions whose complexity increases with the sample size. The construction of couplings is not of the Hungarian type and is instead based on the Slepian-Stein methods and Gaussian comparison inequalities. The increasing complexity of classes of functions and non-centrality of the processes make the results useful for applications in modern nonparametric statistics (Gin\'{e} and Nickl, 2015), in particular allowing us to study the power properties of nonparametric tests using Gaussian and bootstrap approximations.},

  abstract =       {A central challenge to many fields of science and engineering involves minimizing non-convex error functions over continuous, high dimensional spaces. Gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods are almost ubiquitously used to perform such minimizations, and it is often thought that a main source of difficulty for these local methods to find the global minimum is the proliferation of local minima with much higher error than the global minimum. Here we argue, based on results from statistical physics, random matrix theory, neural network theory, and empirical evidence, that a deeper and more profound difficulty originates from the proliferation of saddle points, not local minima, especially in high dimensional problems of practical interest. Such saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus that can dramatically slow down learning, and give the illusory impression of the existence of a local minimum. Motivated by these arguments, we propose a new approach to second-order optimization, the saddle-free Newton method, that can rapidly escape high dimensional saddle points, unlike gradient descent and quasi-Newton methods. We apply this algorithm to deep or recurrent neural network training, and provide numerical evidence for its superior optimization performance.},

  abstract       = {Large data sets often require performing distributed statistical estimation, with a full data set split across multiple machines and limited communication between machines. To study such scenarios, we define and study some refinements of the classical minimax risk that apply to distributed settings, comparing to the performance of estimators with access to the entire data. Lower bounds on these quantities provide a precise characterization of the minimum amount of communication required to achieve the centralized minimax risk. We study two classes of distributed protocols: one in which machines send messages independently over channels without feedback, and a second allowing for interactive communication, in which a central server broadcasts the messages from a given machine to all other machines. We establish lower bounds for a variety of problems, including location estimation in several families and parameter estimation in different types of regression models. Our results include a novel class of quantitative data-processing inequalities used to characterize the effects of limited communication.},

  abstract =       {Measuring conditional dependence is an important topic in statistics with broad applications including graphical models. Under a factor model setting, a new conditional dependence measure is proposed. The measure is derived by using distance covariance after adjusting the common observable factors or covariates. The corresponding conditional independence test is given with the asymptotic null distribution unveiled. The latter gives a somewhat surprising result: the estimating errors in factor loading matrices, while of root$-n$ order, do not have material impact on the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic, which is also in the root$-n$ domain. It is also shown that the new test has strict control over the asymptotic significance level and can be calculated efficiently. A generic method for building dependency graphs using the new test is elaborated. Numerical results and real data analysis show the superiority of the new method.},

  Abstract                 = {In many fields of science, we observe a response variable together with a large number of potential explanatory variables, and would like to be able to discover which variables are truly associated with the response. At the same time, we need to know that the false discovery rate (FDR)---the expected fraction of false discoveries among all discoveries---is not too high, in order to assure the scientist that most of the discoveries are indeed true and replicable. This paper introduces the knockoff filter, a new variable selection procedure controlling the FDR in the statistical linear model whenever there are at least as many observations as variables. This method achieves exact FDR control in finite sample settings no matter the design or covariates, the number of variables in the model, and the amplitudes of the unknown regression coefficients, and does not require any knowledge of the noise level. As the name suggests, the method operates by manufacturing knockoff variables that are cheap---their construction does not require any new data---and are designed to mimic the correlation structure found within the existing variables, in a way that allows for accurate FDR control, beyond what is possible with permutation-based methods. The method of knockoffs is very general and flexible, and can work with a broad class of test statistics. We test the method in combination with statistics from the Lasso for sparse regression, and obtain empirical results showing that the resulting method has far more power than existing selection rules when the proportion of null variables is high. We also apply the knockoff filter to HIV data with the goal of identifying those mutations associated with a form of resistance to treatment plans.},

  abstract =       {We develop in this article a penalized likelihood method to estimate sparse Bayesian networks from categorical data. The structure of a Bayesian network is represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). We model the conditional distribution of a node given its parents by the multi-logit regression and estimate the structure of a DAG via maximizing a regularized likelihood. The adaptive group Lasso penalty is employed to encourage sparsity by selecting grouped dummy variables encoding the level of a factor. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm to solve the penalized likelihood problem subject to the acyclicity constraint of a DAG. When intervention data are available, our method may construct a causal network, in which a directed edge represents a causal relation. We apply our method to various simulated networks and a real biological network. The results show that our method is very competitive, compared to other existing methods, in DAG estimation from both interventional and high-dimensional observational data. We also establish consistency in parameter and structure estimation for our method when the number of nodes is fixed.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider tests of significance in the setting of the graphical lasso for inverse covariance matrix estimation. We propose a simple test statistic based on a subsequence of the knots in the graphical lasso path. We show that this statistic has an exponential asymptotic null distribution, under the null hypothesis that the model contains the true connected components. Though the null distribution is asymptotic, we show through simulation that it provides a close approximation to the true distribution at reasonable sample sizes. Thus the test provides a simple, tractable test for the significance of new edges as they are introduced into the model. Finally, we show connections between our results and other results for regularized regression, as well as extensions of our results to other correlation matrix based methods like single-linkage clustering.},

  abstract =       {We propose an instrumental variables method for estimation in linear models with endogenous regressors in the high-dimensional setting where the sample size n can be smaller than the number of possible regressors K, and L>=K instruments. We allow for heteroscedasticity and we do not need a prior knowledge of variances of the errors. We suggest a new procedure called the STIV (Self Tuning Instrumental Variables) estimator, which is realized as a solution of a conic optimization program. The main results of the paper are upper bounds on the estimation error of the vector of coefficients in l_p-norms for 1<= p<=\infty that hold with probability close to 1, as well as the corresponding confidence intervals. All results are non-asymptotic. These bounds are meaningful under the assumption that the true structural model is sparse, i.e., the vector of coefficients has few non-zero coordinates (less than the sample size n) or many coefficients are too small to matter. In our IV regression setting, the standard tools from the literature on sparsity, such as ther restricted eigenvalue assumption are inapplicable. Therefore, for our analysis we develop a new approach based on data-driven sensitivity characteristics. We show that, under appropriate assumptions, a thresholded STIV estimator correctly selects the non-zero coefficients with probability close to 1. The price to pay for not knowing which coefficients are non-zero and which instruments to use is of the order \sqrt{\log(L)} in the rate of convergence. We extend the procedure to deal with high-dimensional problems where some instruments can be non-valid. We obtain confidence intervals for non-validity indicators and we suggest a procedure, which correctly detects the non-valid instruments with probability close to 1.},

  Abstract                 = {This article considers the problem of sparse estimation of canonical vectors in linear discriminant analysis when $p\gg N$. Several methods have been proposed in the literature that estimate one canonical vector in the two-group case. However, $G-1$ canonical vectors can be considered if the number of groups is $G$. In the multi-group context, it is common to estimate canonical vectors in a sequential fashion. Moreover, separate prior estimation of the covariance structure is often required. We propose a novel methodology for direct estimation of canonical vectors. In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed method estimates all canonical vectors at once, performs variable selection across all the vectors and comes with theoretical guarantees on the variable selection and classification consistency. First, we highlight the fact that in the $N>p$ setting the canonical vectors can be expressed in a closed form up to an orthogonal transformation. Secondly, we propose an extension of this form to the $p\gg N$ setting and achieve feature selection by using a group penalty. The resulting optimization problem is convex and can be solved using a block-coordinate descent algorithm. The practical performance of the method is evaluated through simulation studies as well as real data applications.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we consider the problem of recovering a high dimensional data matrix from a set of incomplete and noisy linear measurements. We introduce a new model that can efficiently restrict the degrees of freedom of the problem and is generic enough to find a lot of applications, for instance in multichannel signal compressed sensing (e.g. sensor networks, hyperspectral imaging) and compressive sparse principal component analysis (s-PCA). We assume data matrices have a simultaneous low-rank and joint sparse structure, and we propose a novel approach for efficient compressed sensing (CS) of such data. Our CS recovery approach is based on a convex minimization problem that incorporates this restrictive structure by jointly regularizing the solutions with their nuclear (trace) norm and l2/l1 mixed norm. Our theoretical analysis uses a new notion of restricted isometry property (RIP) and shows that, for sampling schemes satisfying RIP, our approach can stably recover all low-rank and joint-sparse matrices. For a certain class of random sampling schemes satisfying a particular concentration bound (e.g. the subgaussian ensembles) we derive a lower bound on the number of CS measurements indicating the near-optimality of our recovery approach as well as a significant enhancement compared to the state-of-the-art. We introduce an iterative algorithm based on proximal calculus in order to solve the joint nuclear and l2/l1 norms minimization problem and, finally, we illustrate the empirical recovery phase transition of this approach by series of numerical experiments.},

  abstract       = {Given $n$ i.i.d. observations of a random vector $(X,Z)$, where $X$ is a high-dimensional vector and $Z$ is a low-dimensional index variable, we study the problem of estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix $\Omega(z) = (E[(X-E[X \mid Z])(X-E[X \mid Z])^T \mid Z=z])^{-1}$ under the assumption that the set of non-zero elements is small and does not depend on the index variable. We develop a novel procedure that combines the ideas of the local constant smoothing and the group Lasso for estimating the conditional inverse covariance matrix. A proximal iterative smoothing algorithm is used to solve the corresponding convex optimization problems. We prove that our procedure recovers the conditional independence assumptions of the distribution $X \mid Z$ with high probability. This result is established by developing a uniform deviation bound for the high-dimensional conditional covariance matrix from its population counterpart, which may be of independent interest. Furthermore, we develop point-wise confidence intervals for individual elements of the conditional inverse covariance matrix. We perform extensive simulation studies, in which we demonstrate that our proposed procedure outperforms sensible competitors. We illustrate our proposal on a S&P 500 stock price data set.},

The data are assumed to be a collection of multiple non-Gaussian realizations with underlying undirected graphical structures. Utilizing the concept of median graphs in summarizing the commonality across these graphical structures, a novel semiparametric approach to modeling such complex aggregated data is provided along with robust estimation of the median graph, which is assumed to be sparse. The estimator is proved to be consistent in graph recovery and an upper bound on the rate of convergence is given. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed models and methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Correlation matrix plays a key role in many multivariate methods (e.g., graphical model estimation and factor analysis). The current state-of-the-art in estimating large correlation matrices focuses on the use of Pearson's sample correlation matrix. Although Pearson's sample correlation matrix enjoys various good properties under Gaussian models, its not an effective estimator when facing heavy-tail distributions with possible outliers. As a robust alternative, \cite{han2012transelliptical} advocated the use of a transformed version of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix in estimating high dimensional latent generalized correlation matrix under the transelliptical distribution family (or elliptical copula). The transelliptical family assumes that after unspecified marginal monotone transformations, the data follow an elliptical distribution. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of the Kendall's tau sample correlation matrix and its transformed version proposed in \cite{han2012transelliptical} for estimating the population Kendall's tau correlation matrix and the latent Pearson's correlation matrix under both spectral and restricted spectral norms. With regard to the spectral norm, we highlight the role of "effective rank" in quantifying the rate of convergence. With regard to the restricted spectral norm, we for the first time present a "sign subgaussian condition" which is sufficient to guarantee that the rank-based correlation matrix estimator attains the optimal rate of convergence. In both cases, we do not need any moment condition.},

For this, we consider two families of distribution-free test statistics that converge weakly to an extreme value type I distribution. We further study the powers of the corresponding tests against certain alternatives. In particular, we show that the powers tend to one when the maximum magnitude of the pairwise Pearson's correlation coefficients is larger than C(log d/n)^{1/2} for some absolute constant C. This result is rate optimal. As important examples, we show that the tests based on Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are rate optimal tests of independence. For further generalization, we consider accelerating the rate of convergence via approximating the exact distributions of the test statistics. We also study the tests of two more structural hypotheses: m-dependence and data homogeneity. For these, we propose two rank-based tests and show their optimality.},

  abstract =       {Alternating Minimization is a widely used and empirically successful heuristic for matrix completion and related low-rank optimization problems. Theoretical guarantees for Alternating Minimization have been hard to come by and are still poorly understood. This is in part because the heuristic is iterative and non-convex in nature. We give a new algorithm based on Alternating Minimization that provably recovers an unknown low-rank matrix from a random subsample of its entries under a standard incoherence assumption. Our results reduce the sample size requirements of the Alternating Minimization approach by at least a quartic factor in the rank and the condition number of the unknown matrix. These improvements apply even if the matrix is only close to low-rank in the Frobenius norm. Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time in the dimension of the matrix and, in a broad range of parameters, gives the strongest sample bounds among all subquadratic time algorithms that we are aware of. Underlying our work is a new robust convergence analysis of the well-known Power Method for computing the dominant singular vectors of a matrix. This viewpoint leads to a conceptually simple understanding of Alternating Minimization. In addition, we contribute a new technique for controlling the coherence of intermediate solutions arising in iterative algorithms based on a smoothed analysis of the QR factorization. These techniques may be of interest beyond their application here.},

Despite the pervasive need for such an estimation method, to date there is no such method that models all variables on their proper domain. We close this methodological gap by combining a new class of mixed graphical models with a structure estimation approach based on generalized covariance matrices. We report the performance of our methods using simulations, illustrate the method with a dataset on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and provide an implementation as an R-package.},

Naive testing methods are easy to understand and performs robust especially when the dimension is large. In this paper, we mainly focus on reviewing some naive testing methods for the mean vectors and covariance matrices of high dimensional populations and believe this naive test idea can be wildly used in many other testing problems.},

  abstract =       {Distributed statistical inference has recently attracted enormous attention. Many existing work focuses on the averaging estimator. We propose a one-step approach to enhance a simple-averaging based distributed estimator. We derive the corresponding asymptotic properties of the newly proposed estimator. We find that the proposed one-step estimator enjoys the same asymptotic properties as the centralized estimator. The proposed one-step approach merely requires one additional round of communication in relative to the averaging estimator; so the extra communication burden is insignificant. In finite sample cases, numerical examples show that the proposed estimator outperforms the simple averaging estimator with a large margin in terms of the mean squared errors. A potential application of the one-step approach is that one can use multiple machines to speed up large scale statistical inference with little compromise in the quality of estimators. The proposed method becomes more valuable when data can only be available at distributed machines with limited communication bandwidth.},

  abstract       = {This thesis studies high-dimensional, continuous-valued pairwise Markov Random Fields. We are particularly interested in approximating pairwise densities whose logarithm belongs to a Sobolev space. For this problem we propose the method of exponential series [Crain, 1974; Barron and Sheu, 1991], which approximates the log density by a finite- dimensional exponential family with the number of sufficient statistics increasing with the sample size. We consider two approaches to estimating these models. The first is regularized maximum likelihood. This involves optimizing the sum of the log-likelihood of the data and a sparsity-inducing regularizer. We provide consistency and edge selection guarantees for this method. We then propose a variational approximation to the likelihood based on tree- reweighted, nonparametric message passing. We then consider estimation using regularized score matching. This approach uses an alternative scoring rule to the log-likelihood, which obviates the need to compute the normalizing constant of the distribution. For general continuous-valued exponential families, we provide parameter and edge consistency results. We then describe results for model selection in the nonparametric pairwise model using exponential series. The regularized score matching problem is shown to be a convex program; we provide scalable algorithms based on consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM, [Boyd et al., 2011]) and Coordinate-wise Descent. We compare our method to others in the literature as well as the aforementioned TRW estimator using simulated data.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of fitting the parameters of a high-dimensional linear regression model. In the regime where the number of parameters $p$ is comparable to or exceeds the sample size $n$, a successful approach uses an $\ell_1$-penalized least squares estimator, known as Lasso. Unfortunately, unlike for linear estimators (e.g., ordinary least squares), no well-established method exists to compute confidence intervals or p-values on the basis of the Lasso estimator. Very recently, a line of work \cite{javanmard2013hypothesis, confidenceJM, GBR-hypothesis} has addressed this problem by constructing a debiased version of the Lasso estimator. In this paper, we study this approach for random design model, under the assumption that a good estimator exists for the precision matrix of the design. Our analysis improves over the state of the art in that it establishes nearly optimal \emph{average} testing power if the sample size $n$ asymptotically dominates $s_0 (\log p)^2$, with $s_0$ being the sparsity level (number of non-zero coefficients). Earlier work obtains provable guarantees only for much larger sample size, namely it requires $n$ to asymptotically dominate $(s_0 \log p)^2$. In particular, for random designs with a sparse precision matrix we show that an estimator thereof having the required properties can be computed efficiently. Finally, we evaluate this approach on synthetic data and compare it with earlier proposals.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the two-step estimation of a high dimensional additive regression model, in which the number of nonparametric additive components is potentially larger than the sample size but the number of significant additive components is sufficiently small. The approach investigated consists of two steps. The first step implements the variable selection, typically by the group Lasso, and the second step applies the penalized least squares estimation with Sobolev penalties to the selected additive components. Such a procedure is computationally simple to implement and, in our numerical experiments, works reasonably well. Despite its intuitive nature, the theoretical properties of this two-step procedure have to be carefully analyzed, since the effect of the first step variable selection is random, and generally it may contain redundant additive components and at the same time miss significant additive components. This paper derives a generic performance bound on the two-step estimation procedure allowing for these situations, and studies in detail the overall performance when the first step variable selection is implemented by the group Lasso.},

  abstract = {Abstract We deal with the multiple output regression task where the central theme is to capture the sparse output correlation among the output variables. Sparse inverse covariance learning of linear Gaussian conditional models has been recently studied, shown to achieve superb prediction performance. However, it can fail when the underlying true input-output process is non-Gaussian and/or non-linear. We introduce a novel sparse conditional copula model to represent the joint density of the output variables. By incorporating a Gaussian copula function, yet modeling univariate marginal densities by (non-Gaussian) mixtures of experts, we achieve high flexibility in representation that admits non-linear and non-Gaussian densities. We then propose a sparse learning method for this copula-based model that effectively imposes sparsity in the conditional dependency among output variables. The learning optimization is efficient as it can be decomposed into gradient-descent marginal density estimation and the sparse inverse covariance learning for the copula function. Improved performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on several interesting image/vision tasks with high dimensions.},

  abstract  = {High-dimensional discriminant analysis is of fundamental importance in multivariate statistics. Existing theoretical results sharply characterize different procedures, providing sharp convergence results for the classification risk, as well as the l2 convergence results to the discriminative rule. However, sharp theoretical results for the problem of variable selection have not been established, even though model interpretation is of importance in many scientific domains. In this paper, we  bridge this gap by providing sharp sufficient conditions for consistent variable selection using the ROAD estimator (Fan et al., 2010). Our results provide novel theoretical insights for the ROAD estimator. Sufficient conditions are complemented by the necessary information theoretic limits on variable selection in high-dimensional discriminant analysis. This complementary result also establishes optimality of the ROAD estimator for a certain family of problems.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the localization of a cluster of activated vertices in a graph, from adaptively designed compressive measurements. We propose a hierarchical partitioning of the graph that groups the activated vertices into few partitions, so that a top-down sensing procedure can identify these partitions, and hence the activations, using few measurements. By exploiting the cluster structure, we are able to provide localization guarantees at weaker signal to noise ratios than in the unstructured setting. We complement this performance guarantee with an information theoretic lower bound, providing a necessary signal-to-noise ratio for any algorithm to successfully localize the cluster. We verify our analysis with some simulations, demonstrating the practicality of our algorithm.},

The applications include empirical risk minimization problems in statistical machine learning where the datasets are large and have to be stored on different machines. We design a distributed stochastic variance reduced gradient algorithm that, under certain conditions on the condition number, simultaneously achieves the optimal parallel runtime, amount of communication and rounds of communication among all distributed first-order methods up to constant factors. Our method and its accelerated extension also outperform existing distributed algorithms in terms of the rounds of communication as long as the condition number is not too large compared to the size of data in each machine. We also prove a lower bound for the number of rounds of communication for a broad class of distributed first-order methods including the proposed algorithms in this paper. We show that our accelerated distributed stochastic variance reduced gradient algorithm achieves this lower bound so that it uses the fewest rounds of communication among all distributed first-order algorithms.},

  abstract =       {We treat the problem of testing independence between $m$ continuous observations when the available sample size $n$ is comparable to $m$. Making no specific distributional assumptions, we consider two related classes of test statistics. Statistics of the first considered type are formed by summing up the squares of all pairwise sample rank correlations. Statistics of the second type are U-statistics that unbiasedly estimate the expected sum of squared rank correlations. In the asymptotic regime where the ratio $m/n$ converges to a positive constant, a martingale central limit theorem is applied to show that the null distributions of these statistics converge to Gaussian limits. Using the framework of U-statistics, our result covers a variety of rank correlations including Kendall's tau and a dominating term of Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rho), but also degenerate U-statistics such as Hoeffding's $D$, or the $\tau^*$ of Bergsma and Dassios (2014). For degenerate statistics, the asymptotic variance of the test statistics involves a fourth moment of the kernel that does not appear in classical U-statistic theory. The power of the considered tests is explored in rate-optimality theory under a Gaussian equicorrelation alternative as well as in numerical experiments for specific cases of more general alternatives.},

  abstract =       {Testing independence is of significant interest in many important areas of large-scale inference. Using extreme-value form statistics to test against sparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense alternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional independence. However, quadratic form statistics suffer from low power against sparse alternatives, and extreme-value form statistics suffer from low power against dense alternatives with small disturbances and may have size distortions due to its slow convergence. For real-world applications, it is important to derive powerful testing procedures against more general alternatives. Based on intermediate limiting distributions, we derive (model-free) joint limiting laws of extreme-value form and quadratic form statistics, and surprisingly, we prove that they are asymptotically independent. Given such asymptotic independencies, we propose (model-free) testing procedures to boost the power against general alternatives and also retain the correct asymptotic size. Under the high-dimensional setting, we derive the closed-form limiting null distributions, and obtain their explicit rates of uniform convergence. We prove their consistent statistical powers against general alternatives. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed test statistics in simulation studies. Our work provides very helpful insights to high-dimensional independence tests, and fills an important gap.},

  Abstract                 = {The generalized partially linear additive model (GPLAM) is a flexible and interpretable approach to building predictive models. It combines features in an additive manner, allowing them to have either a linear or nonlinear effect on the response. However, the assignment of features to the linear and nonlinear groups is typically assumed known. Thus, to make a GPLAM a viable approach in situations in which little is known $apriori$ about the features, one must overcome two primary model selection challenges: deciding which features to include in the model and determining which features to treat nonlinearly. We introduce sparse partially linear additive models (SPLAMs), which combine model fitting and $both$ of these model selection challenges into a single convex optimization problem. SPLAM provides a bridge between the Lasso and sparse additive models. Through a statistical oracle inequality and thorough simulation, we demonstrate that SPLAM can outperform other methods across a broad spectrum of statistical regimes, including the high-dimensional ($p\gg N$) setting.

  abstract =       {A massive dataset often consists of a growing number of (potentially) heterogeneous sub-populations. This paper is concerned about testing various forms of heterogeneity arising from massive data. In a general nonparametric framework, a set of testing procedures are designed to accommodate a growing number of sub-populations, denoted as $s$, with computational feasibility. In theory, their null limit distributions are derived as being nearly Chi-square with diverging degrees of freedom as long as $s$ does not grow too fast. Interestingly, we find that a lower bound on $s$ needs to be set for obtaining a sufficiently powerful testing result, so-called "blessing of aggregation." As a by-produc, a type of homogeneity testing is also proposed with a test statistic being aggregated over all sub-populations. Numerical results are presented to support our theory.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a method for testing whether hierarchically ordered groups of potentially correlated variables are significant for explaining a response in a high-dimensional linear model. In presence of highly correlated variables, as is very common in high-dimensional data, it seems indispensable to go beyond an approach of inferring individual regression coefficients. Thanks to the hierarchy among the groups of variables, powerful multiple testing adjustment is possible which leads to a data-driven choice of the resolution level for the groups. Our procedure, based on repeated sample splitting, is shown to asymptotically control the familywise error rate and we provide empirical results for simulated and real data which complement the theoretical analysis.},

  abstract =       {This paper addresses the problem of scalable optimization for L1-regularized conditional Gaussian graphical models. Conditional Gaussian graphical models generalize the well-known Gaussian graphical models to conditional distributions to model the output network influenced by conditioning input variables. While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve one million dimensional problems to high accuracy in a little over a day on a single machine.},

  abstract =       {The vector autoregression (VAR) has long proven to be an effective method for modeling the joint dynamics of macroe- conomic time series as well as forecasting. A major shortcomings of the VAR that has hindered its applicability is its heavy parameterization: the parameter space grows quadratically with the number of series included, quickly exhausting the available degrees of freedom. Consequently, forecasting using VARs is intractable for low-frequency, high-dimensional macroeconomic data. However, empirical evidence suggests that VARs that incorporate more component series tend to result in more accurate forecasts. Conventional methods that allow for the estimation of large VARs either tend to require ad hoc subjective specifications or are computationally infeasible. Moreover, as global economies become more intricately intertwined, there has been substantial interest in incorporating the impact of stochastic, unmodeled exogenous variables. Vector autoregression with exogenous variables (VARX) extends the VAR to allow for the inclusion of unmodeled variables, but it similarly faces dimensionality challenges. We introduce the VARX-L framework, a structured family of VARX models, and provide methodology which allows for both efficient estimation and accurate forecasting in high-dimensional analysis. VARX-L adapts several prominent scalar regression regularization techniques to a vector time series context to greatly reduce the parameter space of VAR and VARX models. We formulate convex optimization procedures that are amenable to efficient solutions for the time-ordered, high-dimensional problems we aim to solve. We also highlight a compelling extension that allows for shrinking toward reference models. We demonstrate the efficacy of VARX-L in both low- and high-dimensional macroeconomic applications and simulated data examples.},

  abstract =       {Vector autoregression (VAR) is a fundamental tool for modeling the joint dynamics of multivariate time series. However, as the number of component series is increased, the VAR model quickly becomes overparameterized, making reliable estimation difficult and impeding its adoption as a forecasting tool in high dimensional settings. A number of authors have sought to address this issue by incorporating regularized approaches, such as the lasso, that impose sparse or low-rank structures on the estimated coefficient parameters of the VAR. More traditional approaches attempt to address overparameterization by selecting a low lag order, based on the assumption that dynamic dependence among components is short-range. However, these methods typically assume a single, universal lag order that applies across all components, unnecessarily constraining the dynamic relationship between the components and impeding forecast performance. The lasso-based approaches are more flexible but do not incorporate the notion of lag order selection. We propose a new class of regularized VAR models, called hierarchical vector autoregression (HVAR), that embed the notion of lag selection into a convex regularizer. The key convex modeling tool is a group lasso with nested groups which ensure the sparsity pattern of autoregressive lag coefficients honors the ordered structure inherent to VAR. We provide computationally efficient algorithms for solving HVAR problems that can be parallelized across the components. A simulation study shows the improved performance in forecasting and lag order selection over previous approaches, and a macroeconomic application further highlights forecasting improvements as well as the convenient, interpretable output of a HVAR model.},

  abstract =       {We propose a likelihood ratio based inferential framework for high dimensional semiparametric generalized linear models. This framework addresses a variety of challenging problems in high dimensional data analysis, including incomplete data, selection bias, and heterogeneous multitask learning. Our work has three main contributions. (i) We develop a regularized statistical chromatography approach to infer the parameter of interest under the proposed semiparametric generalized linear model without the need of estimating the unknown base measure function. (ii) We propose a new framework to construct post-regularization confidence regions and tests for the low dimensional components of high dimensional parameters. Unlike existing post-regularization inferential methods, our approach is based on a novel directional likelihood. In particular, the framework naturally handles generic regularized estimators with nonconvex penalty functions and it can be used to infer least false parameters under misspecified models. (iii) We develop new concentration inequalities and normal approximation results for U-statistics with unbounded kernels, which are of independent interest. We demonstrate the consequences of the general theory by using an example of missing data problem. Extensive simulation studies and real data analysis are provided to illustrate our proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Finite sample properties of random covariance-type matrices have been the subject of much research. In this paper we focus on the "lower tail" of such a matrix, and prove that it is subgaussian under a simple fourth moment assumption on the one-dimensional marginals of the random vectors. A similar result holds for more general sums of random positive semidefinite matrices, and the (relatively simple) proof uses a variant of the so-called PAC-Bayesian method for bounding empirical processes. We give two applications of the main result. In the first one we obtain a new finite-sample bound for ordinary least squares estimator in linear regression with random design. Our result is model-free, requires fairly weak moment assumptions and is almost optimal. Our second application is to bounding restricted eigenvalue constants of certain random ensembles with "heavy tails". These constants are important in the analysis of problems in Compressed Sensing and High Dimensional Statistics, where one recovers a sparse vector from a small umber of linear measurements. Our result implies that heavy tails still allow for the fast recovery rates found in efficient methods such as the LASSO and the Dantzig selector. Along the way we strengthen, with a fairly short argument, a recent result of Rudelson and Zhou on the restricted eigenvalue property.},

  abstract =       {Random projection (RP) is a classical technique for reducing storage and computational costs. We analyze RP-based approximations of convex programs, in which the original optimization problem is approximated by the solution of a lower-dimensional problem. Such dimensionality reduction is essential in computation-limited settings, since the complexity of general convex programming can be quite high (e.g., cubic for quadratic programs, and substantially higher for semidefinite programs). In addition to computational savings, random projection is also useful for reducing memory usage, and has useful properties for privacy-sensitive optimization. We prove that the approximation ratio of this procedure can be bounded in terms of the geometry of constraint set. For a broad class of random projections, including those based on various sub-Gaussian distributions as well as randomized Hadamard and Fourier transforms, the data matrix defining the cost function can be projected down to the statistical dimension of the tangent cone of the constraints at the original solution, which is often substantially smaller than the original dimension. We illustrate consequences of our theory for various cases, including unconstrained and $\ell_1$-constrained least squares, support vector machines, low-rank matrix estimation, and discuss implications on privacy-sensitive optimization and some connections with de-noising and compressed sensing.},

For self-concordant functions, we prove that the algorithm has super-linear convergence with exponentially high probability, with convergence and complexity guarantees that are independent of condition numbers and related problem-dependent quantities. Given a suitable initialization, similar guarantees also hold for strongly convex and smooth objectives without self-concordance. When implemented using randomized projections based on a sub-sampled Hadamard basis, the algorithm typically has substantially lower complexity than Newton's method. We also describe extensions of our methods to programs involving convex constraints that are equipped with self-concordant barriers. We discuss and illustrate applications to linear programs, quadratic programs with convex constraints, logistic regression and other generalized linear models, as well as semidefinite programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Given n observations of a p-dimensional random vector, the covariance matrix and its inverse (precision matrix) are needed in a wide range of applications. Sample covariance (e.g. its eigenstructure) can misbehave when p is comparable to the sample size n. Regularization is often used to mitigate the problem. In this paper, we proposed an l1-norm penalized pseudo-likelihood estimate for the inverse covariance matrix. This estimate is sparse due to the l1-norm penalty, and we term this method SPLICE. Its regularization path can be computed via an algorithm based on the homotopy/LARS-Lasso algorithm. Simulation studies are carried out for various inverse covariance structures for p=15 and n=20, 1000. We compare SPLICE with the l1-norm penalized likelihood estimate and a l1-norm penalized Cholesky decomposition based method. SPLICE gives the best overall performance in terms of three metrics on the precision matrix and ROC curve for model selection. Moreover, our simulation results demonstrate that the SPLICE estimates are positive-definite for most of the regularization path even though the restriction is not enforced.},

  abstract       = {Large scale optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning and data analysis and there is a plethora of algorithms for solving such problems. Many of these algorithms employ sub-sampling, as a way to either speed up the computations and/or to implicitly implement a form of statistical regularization. In this paper, we consider second-order iterative optimization algorithms and we provide bounds on the convergence of the variants of Newton's method that incorporate uniform sub-sampling as a means to estimate the gradient and/or Hessian. Our bounds are non-asymptotic and quantitative. Our algorithms are global and are guaranteed to converge from any initial iterate. Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can sub-sample the Hessian to preserve the curvature information. Our first algorithm incorporates Hessian sub-sampling while using the full gradient. We also give additional convergence results for when the sub-sampled Hessian is regularized by modifying its spectrum or ridge-type regularization. Next, in addition to Hessian sub-sampling, we also consider sub-sampling the gradient as a way to further reduce the computational complexity per iteration. We use approximate matrix multiplication results from randomized numerical linear algebra to obtain the proper sampling strategy. In all these algorithms, computing the update boils down to solving a large scale linear system, which can be computationally expensive. As a remedy, for all of our algorithms, we also give global convergence results for the case of inexact updates where such linear system is solved only approximately. This paper has a more advanced companion paper, [42], in which we demonstrate that, by doing a finer-grained analysis, we can get problem-independent bounds for local convergence of these algorithms and explore trade-offs to improve upon the basic results of the present paper.},

  abstract =       {Many data-fitting applications require the solution of an optimization problem involving a sum of large number of functions of high dimensional parameter. Here, we consider the problem of minimizing a sum of $n$ functions over a convex constraint set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{p}$ where both $n$ and $p$ are large. In such problems, sub-sampling as a way to reduce $n$ can offer great amount of computational efficiency, while maintaining their original convergence properties. Within the context of second order methods, we first give quantitative local convergence results for variants of Newton's method where the Hessian is uniformly sub-sampled. Using random matrix concentration inequalities, one can sub-sample in a way that the curvature information is preserved. Using such sub-sampling strategy, we establish locally Q-linear and Q-superlinear convergence rates. We also give additional convergence results for when the sub-sampled Hessian is regularized by modifying its spectrum or Levenberg-type regularization. Finally, in addition to Hessian sub-sampling, we consider sub-sampling the gradient as way to further reduce the computational complexity per iteration. We use approximate matrix multiplication results from randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA) to obtain the proper sampling strategy and we establish locally R-linear convergence rates. In such a setting, we also show that a very aggressive sample size increase results in a R-superlinearly convergent algorithm. While the sample size depends on the condition number of the problem, our convergence rates are problem-independent, i.e., they do not depend on the quantities related to the problem. Hence, our analysis here can be used to complement the results of our basic framework from the companion paper, [38], by exploring algorithmic trade-offs that are important in practice.},

  abstract =       {A common approach to statistical learning with big-data is to randomly split it among $m$ machines and learn the parameter of interest by averaging the $m$ individual estimates. In this paper, focusing on empirical risk minimization, or equivalently M-estimation, we study the statistical error incurred by this strategy. We consider two large-sample settings: First, a classical setting where the number of parameters $p$ is fixed, and the number of samples per machine $n\to\infty$. Second, a high-dimensional regime where both $p,n\to\infty$ with $p/n \to \kappa \in (0,1)$. For both regimes and under suitable assumptions, we present asymptotically exact expressions for this estimation error. In the fixed-$p$ setting, under suitable assumptions, we prove that to leading order averaging is as accurate as the centralized solution. We also derive the second order error terms, and show that these can be non-negligible, notably for non-linear models. The high-dimensional setting, in contrast, exhibits a qualitatively different behavior: data splitting incurs a first-order accuracy loss, which to leading order increases linearly with the number of machines. The dependence of our error approximations on the number of machines traces an interesting accuracy-complexity tradeoff, allowing the practitioner an informed choice on the number of machines to deploy. Finally, we confirm our theoretical analysis with several simulations.},

This derivation relied on the simultaneous measurement of multiple phosphorylated protein and phospholipid components in thousands of individual primary human immune system cells. Perturbing these cells with molecular interventions drove the ordering of connections between pathway components, wherein Bayesian network computational methods automatically elucidated most of the traditionally reported signaling relationships and predicted novel interpathway network causalities, which we verified experimentally. Reconstruction of network models from physiologically relevant primary single cells might be applied to understanding native-state tissue signaling biology, complex drug actions, and dysfunctional signaling in diseased cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite its prevalence in statistical datasets, heteroscedasticity (non-constant sample variances) has been largely ignored in the high-dimensional statistics literature. Recently, studies have shown that the Lasso can accommodate heteroscedastic errors, with minor algorithmic modifications (Belloni et al., 2012; Gautier and Tsybakov, 2013). In this work, we study heteroscedastic regression with linear mean model and log-linear variances model with sparse high-dimensional parameters. In this work, we propose estimating variances in a post-Lasso fashion, which is followed by weighted-least squares mean estimation. These steps employ non-convex penalties as in Fan and Li (2001), which allows us to prove oracle properties for both post-Lasso variance and mean parameter estimates. We reinforce our theoretical findings with experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear and Quadratic Discriminant analysis (LDA/QDA) are common tools for classification problems. For these methods we assume observations are normally distributed within group. We estimate a mean and covariance matrix for each group and classify using Bayes theorem. With LDA, we estimate a single, pooled covariance matrix, while for QDA we estimate a separate covariance matrix for each group. Rarely do we believe in a homogeneous covariance structure between groups, but often there is insufficient data to separately estimate covariance matrices. We propose L1- PDA, a regularized model which adaptively pools elements of the precision matrices. Adaptively pooling these matrices decreases the variance of our estimates (as in LDA), without overly biasing them. In this paper, we propose and discuss this method, give an efficient algorithm to fit it for moderate sized problems, and show its efficacy on real and simulated datasets.},

  abstract =       {One popular approach for nonstructural economic and financial forecasting is to include a large number of economic and financial variables, which has been shown to lead to significant improvements for forecasting, for example, by the dynamic factor models. A challenging issue is to determine which variables and (their) lags are relevant, especially when there is a mixture of serial correlation (temporal dynamics), high dimensional (spatial) dependence structure and moderate sample size (relative to dimensionality and lags). To this end, an \textit{integrated} solution that addresses these three challenges simultaneously is appealing. We study the large vector auto regressions here with three types of estimates. We treat each variable's own lags different from other variables' lags, distinguish various lags over time, and is able to select the variables and lags simultaneously. We first show the consequences of using Lasso type estimate directly for time series without considering the temporal dependence. In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an estimate as efficient as an \textit{oracle} under such scenarios. The tuning parameters are chosen via a data driven "rolling scheme" method to optimize the forecasting performance. A macroeconomic and financial forecasting problem is considered to illustrate its superiority over existing estimators.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have established that many high dimensional signals can be accurately recovered from a relatively small number of non-adaptive linear observations, provided that the signals possess a sparse representation in some basis. Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved by exploiting additional structure in the locations of the nonzero signal coefficients during inference, or by utilizing some form of data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the sensing process. To our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the notions of adaptive sensing and structured sparsity -- that work examined the task of support recovery from noisy linear measurements, and established that an adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing strategies that are agnostic to the underlying structure. In this work we establish fundamental performance limits for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from noisy measurements, in settings where measurements may be obtained either non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement strategy motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing strategy. Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree sensing procedure analyzed in our previous work is nearly optimal, in the sense that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform fundamentally better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals.},

  abstract =       {In many practical applications of supervised learning the task involves the prediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input variables. When the prediction targets are binary the task is called multi-label classification, while when the targets are continuous the task is called multi-target regression. In both tasks, target variables often exhibit statistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive accuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label classification methods address this challenge by building a separate model for each target on an expanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input variables. Despite the success of these methods in the multi-label classification domain, their applicability and effectiveness in multi-target regression has not been studied until now. In this paper, we introduce two new methods for multi-target regression, called Stacked Single-Target and Ensemble of Regressor Chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods of this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these methods - a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables between training and prediction - and develop extensions that use out-of-sample estimates of the target variables during training in order to tackle this problem. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a large and diverse collection of datasets show that, when the discrepancy is appropriately mitigated, the proposed methods attain consistent improvements over the independent regressions baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble of Regression Chains perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art methods including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a multi-objective random forest approach.},

  Abstract                 = {In many practical settings one can sequentially and adaptively guide the collection of future data, based on information extracted from data collected previously. These sequential data collection procedures are known by different names, such as sequential experimental design, active learning or adaptive sensing/sampling. The intricate relation between data analysis and acquisition in adaptive sensing paradigms can be extremely powerful, and often allows for reliable signal estimation and detection in situations where non-adaptive sensing would fail dramatically. In this work we investigate the problem of estimating the support of a structured sparse signal from coordinate-wise observations under the adaptive sensing paradigm. We present a general procedure for support set estimation that is optimal in a variety of cases and shows that through the use of adaptive sensing one can: (i) mitigate the effect of observation noise when compared to non-adaptive sensing and, (ii) capitalize on structural information to a much larger extent than possible with non-adaptive sensing. In addition to a general procedure to perform adaptive sensing in structured settings we present both performance upper bounds, and corresponding lower bounds for both sensing paradigms.},

  Abstract                 = {Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping constitutes a challenging problem due to, among other reasons, the high-dimensional multivariate nature of gene expression traits. Next to the expression heterogeneity produced by confounding factors and other sources of unwanted variation, indirect effects spread throughout genes as a result of genetic, molecular and environmental perturbations. Disentangling direct from indirect effects while adjusting for unwanted variability should help us moving from current parts list of molecular components to understanding how these components work together. In this paper we approach this challenge with mixed graphical Markov models and higher-order conditional independences. To unlock this methodological framework we derive the parameters for an exact likelihood ratio test and demonstrate its fundamental relevance for higher-order conditioning on continuous expression and discrete genotypes. These models show that additive genetic effects propagate through the network as function of gene-gene correlations. The estimation of the eQTL network underlying a well-studied yeast data set using our methodology leads to a sparse structure with more direct genetic and regulatory associations that enable a straightforward comparison of the genetic control of gene expression across chromosomes. More importantly, it reveals that the larger genetic effects are trans-acting on genes located in a different chromosome and with a high number of connections to other genes in the network.},

We present a theory for estimating $f_1$ in settings where $f_2(X_2)$ is more complex than $f_1(X_1)$. The proposed estimation procedure combines two least squares criteria and can be written as an alternating projection procedure. We derive nonasymptotic risk bounds which reveal connections between the performance of our estimators of $f_1$ and the notions of minimal angles and Hilbert-Schmidt operators in the theory of Hilbert spaces. Under additional regularity conditions on the design densities, these bounds can be further improved. Our results establish general assumptions under which the estimators of $f_1$ have up to first order the same sharp upper bound as the corresponding estimators in the model $Y=f_1(X_1)+\epsilon$. As an example we apply the results to an additive model where the number of covariates is large or the nuisance components are considerably less smooth than $f_1$.},

The proposed method is motivated by geometric considerations in Hilbert spaces, and consists in comparing the norms of the projections of the data on various additive subspaces. Our main results are concentration inequalities which lead to conditions making variable selection possible. In special cases these conditions are known to be optimal. As an application we consider the problem of estimating single components. We show that, up to first order, one can estimate a single component as well as if the other components were known.},

In this paper, we propose a high- dimensional multivariate conditional regression model for constructing sparse estimates of the multivariate regression coe?cient matrix that accounts for the dependency struc- ture among the multiple responses. The proposed method decomposes the multivariate regression problem into a series of penalized conditional log-likelihood of each response conditioned on the covariates and other responses. It allows simultaneous estimation of the sparse regression coe?cient matrix and the sparse inverse covariance matrix. The asymptotic selection consistency and normality are established for the diverging dimension of the covariates and number of responses. The e?ectiveness of the pro- posed method is also demonstrated in a variety of simulated examples as well as an application to the Glioblastoma multiforme cancer data.},

  abstract  = {Probabilistic graphical models have been widely used to model complex systems and aid scientific discoveries. Most existing work on high-dimensional estimation of exponential family graphical models, including Gaussian graphical models and Ising models, is focused on consistent model selection. However, these results do not characterize uncertainty in the estimated structure and are of limited value to scientists who worry whether their findings will be reproducible and if the estimated edges are present in the model due to random chance. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for edge parameters in an exponential family graphical models. We prove that the estimator is \sqrtn-consistent and asymptotically Normal.  This result allows us to construct confidence intervals for edge parameters, as well as, hypothesis tests. We establish our results under conditions that are typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation. However, we do not require that the estimator consistently recovers the graph structure. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is robust to model selection mistakes and uniformly valid for a large number of data-generating processes. We illustrate validity of our estimator through extensive simulation studies.},

Next, we establish a primal-dual connection between the Hessian sketch and dual random projection, which allows us to develop an \emphaccelerated iterative dual random projection method by applying the preconditioned conjugate gradient descent on the dual problem. Finally, we tackle the problems of large sample size and high-dimensionality in massive data sets by developing the \emphprimal-dual sketch.  The primal-dual sketch iteratively sketches the primal and dual formulations and requires only a logarithmic number of calls to solvers of small sub-problems to recover the optimum of the original problem up to \empharbitrary precision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets complement our theoretical results.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the adaptive estimation of copula correlation matrix $\Sigma$ for elliptical copulas. In this context, the correlations are connected to Kendall's tau through a sine function transformation. Hence, a natural estimate for $\Sigma$ is the plug-in estimator $\widehat\Sigma$ with Kendall's tau statistic. We first obtain a sharp bound for the operator norm of $\widehat \Sigma - \Sigma$. Then, we study a factor model for $\Sigma$, for which we propose a refined estimator $\widetilde\Sigma$ by fitting a low-rank matrix plus a diagonal matrix to $\widehat\Sigma$ using least squares with a nuclear norm penalty on the low-rank matrix. The bound for the operator norm of $\widehat \Sigma - \Sigma$ serves to scale the penalty term, and we obtain finite sample oracle inequalities for $\widetilde\Sigma$. We also consider an elementary factor model of $\Sigma$, for which we propose closed-form estimators. We provide data-driven versions for all our estimation procedures and performance bounds.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the problem of variable selection in convex nonparametric regression. Under the assumption that the true regression function is convex and sparse, we develop a screening procedure to select a subset of variables that contains the relevant variables. Our approach is a two-stage quadratic programming method that estimates a sum of one-dimensional convex functions, followed by one-dimensional concave regression fits on the residuals. In contrast to previous methods for sparse additive models, the optimization is finite dimensional and requires no tuning parameters for smoothness. Under appropriate assumptions, we prove that the procedure is faithful in the population setting, yielding no false negatives. We give a finite sample statistical analysis, and introduce algorithms for efficiently carrying out the required quadratic programs. The approach leads to computational and statistical advantages over fitting a full model, and provides an effective, practical approach to variable screening in convex regression.},

  abstract =       {Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a standard method for performing non-parametric regression over reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Given $n$ samples, the time and space complexity of computing the KRR estimate scale as $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ respectively, and so is prohibitive in many cases. We propose approximations of KRR based on $m$-dimensional randomized sketches of the kernel matrix, and study how small the projection dimension $m$ can be chosen while still preserving minimax optimality of the approximate KRR estimate. For various classes of randomized sketches, including those based on Gaussian and randomized Hadamard matrices, we prove that it suffices to choose the sketch dimension $m$ proportional to the statistical dimension (modulo logarithmic factors). Thus, we obtain fast and minimax optimal approximations to the KRR estimate for non-parametric regression.},

  Abstract                 = {Minimax $L_2$ risks for high dimensional nonparametric regression are derived under two sparsity assumptions: 1. the true regression surface is a sparse function that depends only on $d=O(\log n)$ important predictors among a list of $p$ predictors, with $\log p= o(n)$; 2. the true regression surface depends on $O(n)$ predictors but is an additive function where each additive component is sparse but may contain two or more interacting predictors and may have a smoothness level different from other components. Broad range general results are presented to facilitate sharp lower and upper bound calculations on minimax risks in terms of modified packing entropies and covering entropies, and are specialized to spaces of additive functions. For either modeling assumption, a practicable extension of the widely used Bayesian Gaussian process regression method is shown to adaptively attain the optimal minimax rate (up to $\log n$ terms) asymptotically as both $n,p \to \infty$ with $\log p = o(n)$.},

  abstract =       {We propose a new class of semiparametric exponential family graphical models for the analysis of high dimensional mixed data. Different from the existing mixed graphical models, we allow the nodewise conditional distributions to be semiparametric generalized linear models with unspecified base measure functions. Thus, one advantage of our method is that it is unnecessary to specify the type of each node and the method is more convenient to apply in practice. Under the proposed model, we consider both problems of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing in high dimensions. In particular, we propose a symmetric pairwise score test for the presence of a single edge in the graph. Compared to the existing methods for hypothesis tests, our approach takes into account of the symmetry of the parameters, such that the inferential results are invariant with respect to the different parametrizations of the same edge. Thorough numerical simulations and a real data example are provided to back up our results.},

The validity of the Gaussian approximation depends on the sample size $n$, the dimension $p$, the moment condition and the dependence of the underlying processes. We also consider an estimator for long-run covariance matrices and study its convergence properties. Our results allow constructing simultaneous confidence intervals for mean vectors of high-dimensional time series with asymptotically correct coverage probabilities. A Gaussian multiplier bootstrap method is proposed. A simulation study indicates the quality of Gaussian approximation with different $n$, $p$ under different moment and dependence conditions.},

  abstract       = {We propose a robust inference procedure for high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension $p$ could grow exponentially fast with the sample size $n$. Our method applies the de-biasing technique together with the composite quantile loss function to construct an estimator that weakly converges to a Normal distribution. This estimator can be used to construct uniformly valid confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests. Our estimator is robust and does not require the existence of first or second moment of the noise distribution. It also preserves efficiency when the second moment does exist, in the sense that the maximum loss in efficiency is less than 30\% compared to the square-loss-based de-biased Lasso estimator. In many cases our estimator is close to or better than the de-biased Lasso estimator, especially when the noise distribution is heavy-tailed. Although the result is a high-dimensional counterpart of the composite quantile regression (CQR) introduced in Zou and Yuan (2008), our procedure does not require solving the $L_1$-penalized CQR in high dimensions. Instead, we allow any first-stage estimator that has a desired convergence rate and empirical sparsity. Furthermore, we consider a high-dimensional simultaneous test for the regression parameter by applying Gaussian approximation and multiplier bootstrap theories. Lastly we study distributed learning and exploit the divide-and-conquer estimator to reduce computation complexity when the sample size is massive. Our de-biasing method does not require the precision matrix corresponding to the design to be sparse, which is commonly required for constructing confidence intervals in high-dimensional linear models. Finally, our theories are empirically tested on synthetic data.},

  abstract =       {We consider a partially linear framework for modelling massive heterogeneous data. The major goal is to extract common features across all sub-populations while exploring heterogeneity of each sub-population. In particular, we propose an aggregation type estimator for the commonality parameter that possesses the (non-asymptotic) minimax optimal bound and asymptotic distribution as if there were no heterogeneity. This oracular result holds when the number of sub-populations does not grow too fast. A plug-in estimator for the heterogeneity parameter is further constructed, and shown to possess the asymptotic distribution as if the commonality information were available. We also test the heterogeneity among a large number of sub-populations. All the above results require to regularize each sub-estimation as though it had the entire sample size. Our general theory applies to the divide-and-conquer approach that is often used to deal with massive homogeneous data. A technical by-product of this paper is the statistical inferences for the general kernel ridge regression. Thorough numerical results are also provided to back up our theory.},

  abstract =       {There has been an increasing interest in testing the equality of large Pearson's correlation matrices. However, in many applications it is more important to test the equality of large rank-based correlation matrices since they are more robust to outliers and nonlinearity. Unlike the Pearson's case, testing the equality of large rank-based statistics has not been well explored and requires us to develop new methods and theory. In this paper, we provide a framework for testing the equality of two large U-statistic based correlation matrices, which include the rank-based correlation matrices as special cases. Our approach exploits extreme value statistics and the Jackknife estimator for uncertainty assessment and is valid under a fully nonparametric model. Theoretically, we develop a theory for testing the equality of U-statistic based correlation matrices. We then apply this theory to study the problem of testing large Kendall's tau correlation matrices and demonstrate its optimality. For proving this optimality, a novel construction of least favourable distributions is developed for the correlation matrix comparison.},

The classical omnibus tests such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cram\`er-von Mises are known to suffer from low power against essentially all but location-scale alternatives. We propose a new two-sample test that modifies the Neyman's smooth test and extend it to the multivariate case based on the idea of projection pursue. The asymptotic null property of the test and its power against local alternatives are studied. The multiplier bootstrap method is employed to compute the critical value of the multivariate test. We establish validity of the bootstrap approximation in the case where the dimension is allowed to grow with the sample size. Numerical studies show that the new testing procedures perform well even for small sample sizes and are powerful in detecting local features or high-frequency components.},

  abstract    = {Additive regression provides an extension of linear regression by modeling the signal of a response as a sum of functions of covariates of relatively low complexity. We study penalized estimation in high-dimensional nonparametric additive regression where functional semi-norms are used to induce smoothness of component functions and the empirical $L_2$ norm is used to induce sparsity. The functional semi-norms can be of Sobolev or bounded variation types and are allowed to be different amongst individual component functions. We establish new oracle inequalities for the predictive performance of such methods under three simple technical conditions: a sub-gaussian condition on the noise, a compatibility condition on the design and the functional classes under consideration, and an entropy condition on the functional classes. For random designs, the sample compatibility condition can be replaced by its population version under an additional condition to ensure suitable convergence of empirical norms. In homogeneous settings where the complexities of the component functions are of the same order, our results provide a spectrum of explicit convergence rates, from the so-called slow rate without requiring the compatibility condition to the fast rate under the hard sparsity or certain $L_q$ sparsity to allow many small components in the true regression function. These results significantly broadens and sharpens existing ones in the literature.},

  year        = {2015},
  abstract    = {Gaussian Graphical Models (GGM) are popularly used in neuroimaging studies based on fMRI, EEG or MEG to estimate functional connectivity, or relationships between remote brain regions. In multi-subject studies, scientists seek to identify the functional brain connections that are different between two groups of subjects, i.e. connections present in a diseased group but absent in controls or vice versa. This amounts to conducting two-sample large scale inference over network edges post graphical model selection, a novel problem we call Population Post Selection Inference. Current approaches to this problem include estimating a network for each subject, and then assuming the subject networks are fixed, conducting two-sample inference for each edge. These approaches, however, fail to account for the variability associated with estimating each subject's graph, thus resulting in high numbers of false positives and low statistical power. By using resampling and random penalization to estimate the post selection variability together with proper random effects test statistics, we develop a new procedure we call $R^{3}$ that solves these problems. Through simulation studies we show that $R^{3}$ offers major improvements over current approaches in terms of error control and statistical power. We apply our method to identify functional connections present or absent in autistic subjects using the ABIDE multi-subject fMRI study.},

The change is assumed to be structured, e.g., sparse, block sparse, node-perturbed sparse, etc., such that it can be characterized by a suitable (atomic) norm. We present and analyze a norm-regularized estimator for directly estimating the change in structure, without having to estimate the structures of the individual Ising models. The estimator can work with any norm, and can be generalized to other graphical models under mild assumptions. We show that only one set of samples, say n_2, needs to satisfy the sample complexity requirement for the estimator to work, and the estimation error decreases as \fracc\sqrt\min(n_1,n_2), where c depends on the Gaussian width of the unit norm ball. For example, for \ell_1 norm applied to s-sparse change, the change can be accurately estimated with \min(n_1,n_2)=O(s \log p) which is sharper than an existing result n_1= O(s^2 \log p) and n_2 = O(n_1^2). Experimental results illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed estimator are presented.},

We, therefore, propose a novel approach, SIMULE (detecting Shared and Individual parts of MULtiple graphs Explicitly) to learn multi-UGM via a constrained L1 minimization. SIMULE automatically infers both specific edge patterns that are unique to each context and shared interactions preserved among all the contexts. Through the L1 constrained formulation, this problem is cast as multiple independent subtasks of linear programming that can be solved efficiently in parallel. In addition to Gaussian data, SIMULE can also handle multivariate Nonparanormal data that greatly relaxes the normality assumption that many real-world applications do not follow. We provide a novel theoretical proof showing that SIMULE achieves a consistent result at the rate O(log(Kp)/n_{tot}). On multiple synthetic datasets and two biomedical datasets, SIMULE shows significant improvement over state-of-the-art multi-sGGM and single-UGM baselines.},

  abstract    = {This work investigates the geometry of a nonconvex reformulation of minimizing a general convex loss function $f(X)$ regularized by the matrix nuclear norm $\|X\|_*$. Nuclear-norm regularized matrix inverse problems are at the heart of many applications in machine learning, signal processing, and control. The statistical performance of nuclear norm regularization has been studied extensively in literature using convex analysis techniques. Despite its optimal performance, the resulting optimization has high computational complexity when solved using standard or even tailored fast convex solvers. To develop faster and more scalable algorithms, we follow the proposal of Burer-Monteiro to factor the matrix variable $X$ into the product of two smaller rectangular matrices $X=UV^T$ and also replace the nuclear norm $\|X\|_*$ with $(\|U\|_F^2+\|V\|_F^2)/2$. In spite of the nonconvexity of the factored formulation, we prove that when the convex loss function $f(X)$ is $(2r,4r)$-restricted well-conditioned, each critical point of the factored problem either corresponds to the optimal solution $X^\star$ of the original convex optimization or is a strict saddle point where the Hessian matrix has a strictly negative eigenvalue. Such a geometric structure of the factored formulation allows many local search algorithms to converge to the global optimum with random initializations.},

In specific, we characterize the locations of stationary points and the null space of the associated Hessian matrices via the lens of invariant groups. As a major motivating example, we apply the proposed general theory to characterize the global geometry of the low-rank matrix factorization problem. In particular, we illustrate how the rotational symmetry group gives rise to infinitely many non-isolated strict saddle points and equivalent global minima of the objective function. By explicitly identifying all stationary points, we divide the entire parameter space into three regions: ($\cR_1$) the region containing the neighborhoods of all strict saddle points, where the objective has negative curvatures; ($\cR_2$) the region containing neighborhoods of all global minima, where the objective enjoys strong convexity along certain directions; and ($\cR_3$) the complement of the above regions, where the gradient has sufficiently large magnitudes. We further extend our result to the matrix sensing problem. This allows us to establish strong global convergence guarantees for popular iterative algorithms with arbitrary initial solutions.},

  abstract    = {Motivated by penalized likelihood maximization in complex models, we study optimization problems where neither the function to optimize nor its gradient have an explicit expression, but its gradient can be approximated by a Monte Carlo technique. We propose a new algorithm based on a stochastic approximation of the Proximal-Gradient (PG) algorithm. This new algorithm, named Stochastic Approximation PG (SAPG) is the combination of a stochastic gradient descent step which - roughly speaking - computes a smoothed approximation of the past gradient along the iterations, and a proximal step. The choice of the step size and the Monte Carlo batch size for the stochastic gradient descent step in SAPG are discussed. Our convergence results cover the cases of biased and unbiased Monte Carlo approximations. While the convergence analysis of the Monte Carlo-PG is already addressed in the literature (see Atchad\'e et al. [2016]), the convergence analysis of SAPG is new. The two algorithms are compared on a linear mixed effect model as a toy example. A more challenging application is proposed on non-linear mixed effect models in high dimension with a pharmacokinetic data set including genomic covariates. To our best knowledge, our work provides the first convergence result of a numerical method designed to solve penalized Maximum Likelihood in a non-linear mixed effect model.},

  title       = {Non-convex Robust PCA},
  abstract    = {We propose a new method for robust PCA -- the task of recovering a low-rank matrix from sparse corruptions that are of unknown value and support. Our method involves alternating between projecting appropriate residuals onto the set of low-rank matrices, and the set of sparse matrices; each projection is {\em non-convex} but easy to compute. In spite of this non-convexity, we establish exact recovery of the low-rank matrix, under the same conditions that are required by existing methods (which are based on convex optimization). For an $m \times n$ input matrix ($m \leq n)$, our method has a running time of $O(r^2mn)$ per iteration, and needs $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations to reach an accuracy of $\epsilon$. This is close to the running time of simple PCA via the power method, which requires $O(rmn)$ per iteration, and $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. In contrast, existing methods for robust PCA, which are based on convex optimization, have $O(m^2n)$ complexity per iteration, and take $O(1/\epsilon)$ iterations, i.e., exponentially more iterations for the same accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real data establishes the improved speed and accuracy of our method over existing convex implementations.},

These results explain why simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have global converge, and efficiently optimize these non-convex objective functions in practice.

  title       = {The Landscape of Empirical Risk for Non-convex Losses},
  abstract    = {Most high-dimensional estimation and prediction methods propose to minimize a cost function (empirical risk) that is written as a sum of losses associated to each data point. In this paper we focus on the case of non-convex losses, which is practically important but still poorly understood. Classical empirical process theory implies uniform convergence of the empirical risk to the population risk. While uniform convergence implies consistency of the resulting M-estimator, it does not ensure that the latter can be computed efficiently. In order to capture the complexity of computing M-estimators, we propose to study the landscape of the empirical risk, namely its stationary points and their properties. We establish uniform convergence of the gradient and Hessian of the empirical risk to their population counterparts, as soon as the number of samples becomes larger than the number of unknown parameters (modulo logarithmic factors). Consequently, good properties of the population risk can be carried to the empirical risk, and we can establish one-to-one correspondence of their stationary points. We demonstrate that in several problems such as non-convex binary classification, robust regression, and Gaussian mixture model, this result implies a complete characterization of the landscape of the empirical risk, and of the convergence properties of descent algorithms. We extend our analysis to the very high-dimensional setting in which the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples, and provide a characterization of the empirical risk landscape under a nearly information-theoretically minimal condition. Namely, if the number of samples exceeds the sparsity of the unknown parameters vector (modulo logarithmic factors), then a suitable uniform convergence result takes place. We apply this result to non-convex binary classification and robust regression in very high-dimension.},

By adjusting the rate and accuracy of the projection, the COOL algorithm allows for a trade-off between the benefit of coordination and the required computation/communication. We derive regret bounds for our approach and analyze how they are influenced by these trade-off factors.

  title       = {Asynchronous Multi-Task Learning},
  abstract    = {Many real-world machine learning applications involve several learning tasks which are inter-related. For example, in healthcare domain, we need to learn a predictive model of a certain disease for many hospitals. The models for each hospital may be different because of the inherent differences in the distributions of the patient populations. However, the models are also closely related because of the nature of the learning tasks modeling the same disease. By simultaneously learning all the tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) paradigm performs inductive knowledge transfer among tasks to improve the generalization performance. When datasets for the learning tasks are stored at different locations, it may not always be feasible to transfer the data to provide a data-centralized computing environment due to various practical issues such as high data volume and privacy. In this paper, we propose a principled MTL framework for distributed and asynchronous optimization to address the aforementioned challenges. In our framework, gradient update does not wait for collecting the gradient information from all the tasks. Therefore, the proposed method is very efficient when the communication delay is too high for some task nodes. We show that many regularized MTL formulations can benefit from this framework, including the low-rank MTL for shared subspace learning. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

We are especially interested in the high dimensional settings where the number of predictors and/or response variables can be much larger than the number of observations. We propose a new estimation scheme, which achieves competitive numerical performance and at the same time allows fast computation. Moreover, we show that (a slight variant of) the proposed estimator achieves near optimal non-asymptotic minimax rates of estimation under a collection of squared Schatten norm losses simultaneously by providing both the error bounds for the estimator and minimax lower bounds. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is also demonstrated on an \textit{in vivo} calcium imaging dataset.},

  abstract    = {In this paper we consider the problem of estimating simultaneously low-rank and row-wise sparse matrices from nested linear measurements where the linear operator consists of the product of a linear operator $\mathcal{W}$ and a matrix $\mathbf{\varPsi}$. Leveraging the nested structure of the measurement operator, we propose a computationally efficient two-stage algorithm for estimating the simultaneously structured target matrix. Assuming that $\mathcal{W}$ is a restricted isometry for low-rank matrices and $\mathbf{\varPsi}$ is a restricted isometry for row-wise sparse matrices, we establish an accuracy guarantee that holds uniformly for all sufficiently low-rank and row-wise sparse matrices with high probability. Furthermore, using standard tools from information theory, we establish a minimax lower bound for estimation of simultaneously low-rank and row-wise sparse matrices from linear measurements that need not be nested. The accuracy bounds established for the algorithm, that also serve as a minimax upper bound, differ from the derived minimax lower bound merely by a polylogarithmic factor of the dimensions. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is nearly minimax optimal. We also discuss some applications of the proposed observation model and evaluate our algorithm through numerical simulation.},

We show that the objective function of the matrix factorization problem has no spurious local minima and obeys the strict saddle property not only for the exact-parameterization case where $rank(X^\star) = r$, but also for the over-parameterization case where $rank(X^\star) < r$ and under-parameterization case where $rank(X^\star) > r$. These geometric properties imply that a number of iterative optimization algorithms (such as gradient descent) converge to a global solution with random initialization. For the exact-parameterization case, we further show that the objective function satisfies the robust strict saddle property, ensuring global convergence of many local search algorithms in polynomial time. We extend the geometric analysis to the matrix sensing problem with the factorization approach and prove that this global optimization geometry is preserved as long as the measurement operator satisfies the standard restricted isometry property.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {Learning with Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) has been widely used in many scientific disciplines. Because a RKHS can be very flexible, it is common to impose a regularization term in the optimization to prevent overfitting. Standard RKHS learning employs the squared norm penalty of the learning function. Despite its success, many challenges remain. In particular, one cannot directly use the squared norm penalty for variable selection or data extraction. Therefore, when there exists noise predictors, or the underlying function has a sparse representation in the dual space, the performance of standard RKHS learning can be suboptimal. In the literature,work has been proposed on how to perform variable selection in RKHS learning, and a data sparsity constraint was considered for data extraction. However, how to learn in a RKHS with both variable selection and data extraction simultaneously remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a unified RKHS learning method, namely, DOuble Sparsity Kernel (DOSK) learning, to overcome this challenge. An efficient algorithm is provided to solve the corresponding optimization problem. We prove that under certain conditions, our new method can asymptotically achieve variable selection consistency. Simulated and real data results demonstrate that DOSK is highly competitive among existing approaches for RKHS learning.},

The model is learned by fitting the derivative of the log density, the score, thus avoiding the need to compute a normalization constant. We improved the computational efficiency of an earlier solution with a low-rank, Nystr\"om-like solution. The new solution retains the consistency and convergence rates of the full-rank solution (exactly in Fisher distance, and nearly in other distances), with guarantees on the degree of cost and storage reduction. We evaluate the method in experiments on density estimation and in the construction of an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler. Compared to an existing score learning approach using a denoising autoencoder, our estimator is empirically more data-efficient when estimating the score, runs faster, and has fewer parameters (which can be tuned in a principled and interpretable way), in addition to providing statistical guarantees.},

  year        = {2015},
  abstract    = {We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are distributed (unevenly) over an extremely large number of \nodes, but the goal remains to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of utmost importance. A motivating example for federated optimization arises when we keep the training data locally on users' mobile devices rather than logging it to a data center for training. Instead, the mobile devices are used as nodes performing computation on their local data in order to update a global model. We suppose that we have an extremely large number of devices in our network, each of which has only a tiny fraction of data available totally; in particular, we expect the number of data points available locally to be much smaller than the number of devices. Additionally, since different users generate data with different patterns, we assume that no device has a representative sample of the overall distribution. We show that existing algorithms are not suitable for this setting, and propose a new algorithm which shows encouraging experimental results. This work also sets a path for future research needed in the context of federated optimization.},

  title       = {Inference in High Dimensions with the Penalized Score Test},
  abstract    = {In recent years, there has been considerable theoretical development regarding variable selection consistency of penalized regression techniques, such as the lasso. However, there has been relatively little work on quantifying the uncertainty in these selection procedures. In this paper, we propose a new method for inference in high dimensions using a score test based on penalized regression. In this test, we perform penalized regression of an outcome on all but a single feature, and test for correlation of the residuals with the held-out feature. This procedure is applied to each feature in turn. Interestingly, when an $\ell_1$ penalty is used, the sparsity pattern of the lasso corresponds exactly to a decision based on the proposed test. Further, when an $\ell_2$ penalty is used, the test corresponds precisely to a score test in a mixed effects model, in which the effects of all but one feature are assumed to be random. We formulate the hypothesis being tested as a compromise between the null hypotheses tested in simple linear regression on each feature and in multiple linear regression on all features, and develop reference distributions for some well-known penalties. We also examine the behavior of the test on real and simulated data.},

  abstract    = {We present a structured matrix factorization approach to analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity of each neuron from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. The matrix factorization approach relies on the observation that the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity can be expressed as a product of two matrices: a spatial matrix that encodes the location of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. We present a simple approach for estimating the dynamics of the calcium indicator as well as the observation noise statistics from the observed data. These parameters are then used to set up the matrix factorization problem in a constrained form that requires no further parameter tuning. We discuss initialization and post-processing techniques that enhance the performance of our method, along with efficient and largely parallelizable algorithms. We apply our method to {\it in vivo} large scale multi-neuronal imaging data and also demonstrate how similar methods can be used for the analysis of {\it in vivo} dendritic imaging data.},

  journal     = {Technical report},
  year        = {2014},
  abstract    = {Sparse principal component analysis (PCA) involves nonconvex optimization for which the global solution is hard to obtain. To address this issue, one popular approach is convex relaxation. However, such an approach may produce suboptimal estimators due to the relaxation effect. To optimally estimate sparse principal subspaces, we propose a two-stage computational framework named "tighten after relax": Within the 'relax' stage, we approximately solve a convex relaxation of sparse PCA with early stopping to obtain a desired initial estimator; For the 'tighten' stage, we propose a novel algorithm called sparse orthogonal iteration pursuit (SOAP), which iteratively refines the initial estimator by directly solving the underlying nonconvex problem. A key concept of this two-stage framework is the basin of attraction. It represents a local region within which the `tighten' stage has desired computational and statistical guarantees. We prove that, the initial estimator obtained from the 'relax' stage falls into such a region, and hence SOAP geometrically converges to a principal subspace estimator which is minimax-optimal within a certain model class. Unlike most existing sparse PCA estimators, our approach applies to the non-spiked covariance models, and adapts to non-Gaussianity as well as dependent data settings. Moreover, through analyzing the computational complexity of the two stages, we illustrate an interesting phenomenon that larger sample size can reduce the total iteration complexity. Our framework motivates a general paradigm for solving many complex statistical problems which involve nonconvex optimization with provable guarantees.},

  abstract  = {Matrix completion concerns the recovery of a low-rank matrix from a subset of its revealed entries, and nuclear norm minimization has emerged as an effective surrogate for this combinatorial problem.  Here, we show that nuclear norm minimization can recover an arbitrary n \times n matrix of rank r from O(nr log^2(n)) revealed entries, provided that revealed entries are drawn proportionally to the local row and column coherences (closely related to leverage scores) of the underlying matrix.  Our results are order-optimal up to logarithmic factors, and extend existing results for nuclear norm minimization which require strong incoherence conditions on the types of matrices that can be recovered, due to assumed uniformly distributed revealed entries.  We further provide extensive numerical evidence that a proposed two-phase sampling algorithm can perform nearly as well as local-coherence sampling and without requiring a priori knowledge of the matrix coherence structure.  Finally, we apply our results to quantify how weighted nuclear norm minimization can improve on unweighted minimization given an arbitrary set of sampled entries.},

We combine methods from non-smooth and smooth optimization. At each step we use the proximal gradient to select an active subspace. We then find a smooth, convex relaxation of the smaller subspace problems and solve these using second order methods. We apply our methods to matrix completion problems including Netflix dataset, and show that they are more than 6 times faster than state-of-the-art nuclear norm solvers. Also, this is the first paper to scale nuclear norm solvers to the Yahoo-Music dataset, and the first time in the literature that the efficiency of nuclear norm solvers can be compared and even compete with non-convex solvers like Alternating Least Squares (ALS).},

This type of setting arises naturally in high-dimensional statistics and signal processing, where the variables often reflect different structures or components within the signals being considered. Our analysis depends strongly on the notion of local concavity coefficients, which have been recently proposed in Barber and Ha (2017) to measure and quantify the concavity of a general nonconvex set. Our results further reveal important distinctions between alternating and non-alternating methods. Since computing the alternating minimization steps may not be tractable for some problems, we also consider an inexact version of the algorithm and provide a set of sufficient conditions to ensure fast convergence of the inexact algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on several examples, including low rank + sparse decomposition and multitask regression, and provide numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results.},

In this paper we study the interplay between the geometric properties of the constraint set and the convergence behavior of gradient descent for minimization over this set. We develop the notion of local concavity coefficients of the constraint set, measuring the extent to which convexity is violated, which govern the behavior of projected gradient descent over this set. We demonstrate the versatility of these concavity coefficients by computing them for a range of problems in low-rank estimation, sparse estimation, and other examples. Through our understanding of the role of these geometric properties in optimization, we then provide a convergence analysis when projections are calculated only approximately, leading to a more efficient method for projected gradient descent in low-rank estimation problems.},

  abstract    = {Optimization problems with rank constraints arise in many applications, including matrix regression, structured PCA, matrix completion and matrix decomposition problems. An attractive heuristic for solving such problems is to factorize the low-rank matrix, and to run projected gradient descent on the nonconvex factorized optimization problem. The goal of this problem is to provide a general theoretical framework for understanding when such methods work well, and to characterize the nature of the resulting fixed point. We provide a simple set of conditions under which projected gradient descent, when given a suitable initialization, converges geometrically to a statistically useful solution. Our results are applicable even when the initial solution is outside any region of local convexity, and even when the problem is globally concave. Working in a non-asymptotic framework, we show that our conditions are satisfied for a wide range of concrete models, including matrix regression, structured PCA, matrix completion with real and quantized observations, matrix decomposition, and graph clustering problems. Simulation results show excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions.},

To reduce the computational burden, we factorize the variable $X$ into a product of two smaller matrices and optimize over these two matrices instead of $X$. Despite the resulting nonconvexity, recent studies in matrix completion and sensing have shown that the factored problem has no spurious local minima and obeys the so-called strict saddle property (the function has a directional negative curvature at all critical points but local minima). We analyze the global geometry for a general and yet well-conditioned objective function $f(X)$ whose restricted strong convexity and restricted strong smoothness constants are comparable. In particular, we show that the reformulated objective function has no spurious local minima and obeys the strict saddle property. These geometric properties implies that a number of iterative optimization algorithms (such as gradient descent) can provably solve the factored problem with global convergence.},

  abstract    = {Many modern big data applications feature large scale in both numbers of responses and predictors. Better statistical efficiency and scientific insights can be enabled by understanding the large-scale response-predictor association network structures via layers of sparse latent factors ranked by importance. Yet sparsity and orthogonality have been two largely incompatible goals. To accommodate both features, in this paper we suggest the method of sparse orthogonal factor regression (SOFAR) via the sparse singular value decomposition with orthogonality constrained optimization to learn the underlying association networks, with broad applications to both unsupervised and supervised learning tasks such as biclustering with sparse singular value decomposition, sparse principal component analysis, sparse factor analysis, and spare vector autoregression analysis. Exploiting the framework of convexity-assisted nonconvex optimization, we derive nonasymptotic error bounds for the suggested procedure characterizing the theoretical advantages. The statistical guarantees are powered by an efficient SOFAR algorithm with convergence property. Both computational and theoretical advantages of our procedure are demonstrated with several simulation and real data examples.},

Despite the recent theoretical and algorithmic advances, scalable estimation of sparse reduced-rank regression remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we suggest a scalable procedure called sequential estimation with eigen-decomposition (SEED) which needs only a single top-$r$ singular value decomposition to find the optimal low-rank and sparse matrix by solving a sparse generalized eigenvalue problem. Our suggested method is not only scalable but also performs simultaneous dimensionality reduction and variable selection. Under some mild regularity conditions, we show that SEED enjoys nice sampling properties including consistency in estimation, rank selection, prediction, and model selection. Numerical studies on synthetic and real data sets show that SEED outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for large-scale matrix estimation problem.},

In particular, in addition to approximate sub-problem solves, both the Hessian and the gradient are suitably approximated. Using rather mild conditions on such approximations, we show that our proposed inexact methods achieve similar optimal worst-case iteration complexities as the exact counterparts. Our proposed algorithms, and their respective theoretical analysis, do not require knowledge of any unknowable problem-related quantities, and hence are easily implementable in practice. In the context of finite-sum problems, we then explore randomized sub-sampling methods as ways to construct the gradient and Hessian approximations and examine the empirical performance of our algorithms on some real datasets.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {For distributed computing environments, we consider the canonical machine learning problem of empirical risk minimization (ERM) with quadratic regularization, and we propose a distributed and communication-efficient Newton-type optimization method. At every iteration, each worker locally finds an Approximate NewTon (ANT) direction, and then it sends this direction to the main driver. The driver, then, averages all the ANT directions received from workers to form a Globally Improved ANT (GIANT) direction. GIANT naturally exploits the trade-offs between local computations and global communications in that more local computations result in fewer overall rounds of communications. GIANT is highly communication efficient in that, for $d$-dimensional data uniformly distributed across $m$ workers, it has $4$ or $6$ rounds of communication and $O (d \log m)$ communication complexity per iteration. Theoretically, we show that GIANT's convergence rate is faster than first-order methods and existing distributed Newton-type methods. From a practical point-of-view, a highly beneficial feature of GIANT is that it has only one tuning parameter---the iterations of the local solver for computing an ANT direction. This is indeed in sharp contrast with many existing distributed Newton-type methods, as well as popular first-order methods, which have several tuning parameters, and whose performance can be greatly affected by the specific choices of such parameters. In this light, we empirically demonstrate the superior performance of GIANT compared with other competing methods.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {While first-order optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are popular in machine learning (ML), they come with well-known deficiencies, including relatively-slow convergence, sensitivity to the settings of hyper-parameters such as learning rate, stagnation at high training errors, and difficulty in escaping flat regions and saddle points. These issues are particularly acute in highly non-convex settings such as those arising in neural networks. Motivated by this, there has been recent interest in second-order methods that aim to alleviate these shortcomings by capturing curvature information. In this paper, we report detailed empirical evaluations of a class of Newton-type methods, namely sub-sampled variants of trust region (TR) and adaptive regularization with cubics (ARC) algorithms, for non-convex ML problems. In doing so, we demonstrate that these methods not only can be computationally competitive with hand-tuned SGD with momentum, obtaining comparable or better generalization performance, but also they are highly robust to hyper-parameter settings. Further, in contrast to SGD with momentum, we show that the manner in which these Newton-type methods employ curvature information allows them to seamlessly escape flat regions and saddle points.},

Under mild conditions on the inexact Hessian, and using approximate solution of the corresponding sub-problems, we provide iteration complexity to achieve $ \epsilon $-approximate second-order optimality which have shown to be tight. Our Hessian approximation conditions constitute a major relaxation over the existing ones in the literature. Consequently, we are able to show that such mild conditions allow for the construction of the approximate Hessian through various random sampling methods. In this light, we consider the canonical problem of finite-sum minimization, provide appropriate uniform and non-uniform sub-sampling strategies to construct such Hessian approximations, and obtain optimal iteration complexity for the corresponding sub-sampled trust-region and cubic regularization methods.},

  abstract    = {Dynamic network analysis has found an increasing interest in the literature because of the importance of different kinds of dynamic social networks, biological networks, and economic networks. Most available probability and statistical models for dynamic network data are deduced from random graph theory where the networks are characterized on the node and edge level. They are often very restrictive for applications and unscalable to high-dimensional dynamic network data which is very common nowadays. In this paper, we take a different perspective: The evolving sequence of networks are treated as a time series of network matrices. We adopt a matrix factor model where the observed surface dynamic network is assumed to be driven by a latent dynamic network with lower dimensions. The linear relationship between the surface network and the latent network is characterized by unknown but deterministic loading matrices. The latent network and the corresponding loadings are estimated via an eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix constructed from the auto-cross-covariances of the network times series, thus capturing the dynamics presenting in the network. The proposed method is able to unveil the latent dynamic structure and achieve the objective of dimension reduction. Different from other dynamic network analytical methods that build on latent variables, our approach imposes neither any distributional assumptions on the underlying network nor any parametric forms on its covariance function. The latent network is learned directly from the data with little subjective input. We applied the proposed method to the monthly international trade flow data from 1981 to 2015. The results unveil an interesting evolution of the latent trading network and the relations between the latent entities and the countries.},

For example, many economic indicators are obtained in different countries over time. Various financial characteristics of many companies are reported over time. Although it is natural to turn a matrix observation into a long vector then use standard vector time series models or factor analysis, it is often the case that the columns and rows of a matrix represent different sets of information that are closely interrelated in a very structural way. We propose a novel factor model that maintains and utilizes the matrix structure to achieve greater dimensional reduction as well as finding clearer and more interpretable factor structures.

  abstract    = {In this paper, we consider an unconstrained optimization model where the objective is a sum of a large number of possibly nonconvex functions, though overall the objective is assumed to be smooth and convex. Our bid to solving such model uses the framework of cubic regularization of Newton's method.As well known, the crux in cubic regularization is its utilization of the Hessian information, which may be computationally expensive for large-scale problems. To tackle this, we resort to approximating the Hessian matrix via sub-sampling. In particular, we propose to compute an approximated Hessian matrix by either uniformly or non-uniformly sub-sampling the components of the objective. Based upon sub-sampling, we develop both standard and accelerated adaptive cubic regularization approaches and provide theoretical guarantees on global iteration complexity. We show that the standard and accelerated sub-sampled cubic regularization methods achieve iteration complexity in the order of $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ and $O(\epsilon^{-1/3})$ respectively, which match those of the original standard and accelerated cubic regularization methods \cite{Cartis-2012-Evaluation, Jiang-2017-Unified} using the full Hessian information. The performances of the proposed methods on regularized logistic regression problems show a clear effect of acceleration in terms of epochs on several real data sets.},

  journal     = {arxiv:1711.10467},
  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {Recent years have seen a flurry of activities in designing provably efficient nonconvex procedures for solving statistical estimation problems. Due to the highly nonconvex nature of the empirical loss, state-of-the-art procedures often require proper regularization (e.g. trimming, regularized cost, projection) in order to guarantee fast convergence. For vanilla procedures such as gradient descent, however, prior theory either recommends highly conservative learning rates to avoid overshooting, or completely lacks performance guarantees. This paper uncovers a striking phenomenon in nonconvex optimization: even in the absence of explicit regularization, gradient descent enforces proper regularization implicitly under various statistical models. In fact, gradient descent follows a trajectory staying within a basin that enjoys nice geometry, consisting of points incoherent with the sampling mechanism. This "implicit regularization" feature allows gradient descent to proceed in a far more aggressive fashion without overshooting, which in turn results in substantial computational savings. Focusing on three fundamental statistical estimation problems, i.e. phase retrieval, low-rank matrix completion, and blind deconvolution, we establish that gradient descent achieves near-optimal statistical and computational guarantees without explicit regularization. In particular, by marrying statistical modeling with generic optimization theory, we develop a general recipe for analyzing the trajectories of iterative algorithms via a leave-one-out perturbation argument. As a byproduct, for noisy matrix completion, we demonstrate that gradient descent achieves near-optimal error control --- measured entrywise and by the spectral norm --- which might be of independent interest.},

Our approach is to directly estimate the low-rank factor by minimizing a nonconvex quadratic loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following a tailored spectral initialization. When the true rank is small, this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth (up to global ambiguity) with near-optimal sample complexity and computational complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first guarantee that achieves near-optimality in both metrics. In particular, the key enabler of near-optimal computational guarantees is an implicit regularization phenomenon: without explicit regularization, both spectral initialization and the gradient descent iterates automatically stay within a region incoherent with the measurement vectors. This feature allows one to employ much more aggressive step sizes compared with the ones suggested in prior literature, without the need of sample splitting.},

  abstract    = {Low-rank modeling plays a pivotal role in signal processing and machine learning, with applications ranging from collaborative filtering, video surveillance, medical imaging, to dimensionality reduction and adaptive filtering. Many modern high-dimensional data and interactions thereof can be modeled as lying approximately in a low-dimensional subspace or manifold, possibly with additional structures, and its proper exploitations lead to significant reduction of costs in sensing, computation and storage. In recent years, there is a plethora of progress in understanding how to exploit low-rank structures using computationally efficient procedures in a provable manner, including both convex and nonconvex approaches. On one side, convex relaxations such as nuclear norm minimization often lead to statistically optimal procedures for estimating low-rank matrices, where first-order methods are developed to address the computational challenges; on the other side, there is emerging evidence that properly designed nonconvex procedures, such as projected gradient descent, often provide globally optimal solutions with a much lower computational cost in many problems. This survey article will provide a unified overview of these recent advances on low-rank matrix estimation from incomplete measurements. Attention is paid to rigorous characterization of the performance of these algorithms, and to problems where the low-rank matrix have additional structural properties that require new algorithmic designs and theoretical analysis.},

Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions. Our experiments on convolutional and recurrent networks demonstrate that Entropy-SGD compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.},

In many controlled experiments, environmental changes or external stimuli can often alter the conditional dependence between the random variables, and potentially produce significant structural changes in the corresponding graphical models. Therefore, it is of great importance to be able to detect such structural changes from data, so as to gain novel insights into where and how the structural changes take place and help the system adapt to the new environment. Here we report an effective learning strategy to extract structural changes in Gaussian graphical model using l1-regularization based convex optimization. We discuss the properties of the problem formulation and introduce an efficient implementation by the block coordinate descent algorithm. We demonstrate the principle of the approach on a numerical simulation experiment, and we then apply the algorithm to the modeling of gene regulatory networks under different conditions and obtain promising yet biologically plausible results.},

  abstract    = {We design differentially private learning algorithms that are agnostic to the learning model. Our algorithms are interactive in nature, i.e., instead of outputting a model based on the training data, they provide predictions for a set of $m$ feature vectors that arrive online. We show that, for the feature vectors on which an ensemble of models (trained on random disjoint subsets of a dataset) makes consistent predictions, there is almost no-cost of privacy in generating accurate predictions for those feature vectors. To that end, we provide a novel coupling of the distance to instability framework with the sparse vector technique. We provide algorithms with formal privacy and utility guarantees for both binary/multi-class classification, and soft-label classification. For binary classification in the standard (agnostic) PAC model, we show how to bootstrap from our privately generated predictions to construct a computationally efficient private learner that outputs a final accurate hypothesis. Our construction - to the best of our knowledge - is the first computationally efficient construction for a label-private learner. We prove sample complexity upper bounds for this setting. As in non-private sample complexity bounds, the only relevant property of the given concept class is its VC dimension. For soft-label classification, our techniques are based on exploiting the stability properties of traditional learning algorithms, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide a new technique to boost the average-case stability properties of learning algorithms to strong (worst-case) stability properties, and then exploit them to obtain private classification algorithms. In the process, we also show that a large class of SGD methods satisfy average-case stability properties, in contrast to a smaller class of SGD methods that are uniformly stable as shown in prior work.},

To fully utilize the information contained in big data, we propose a two-step procedure: (i) estimate conditional quantile functions at different levels in a parallel computing environment; (ii) construct a conditional quantile regression process through projection based on these estimated quantile curves. Our general quantile regression framework covers both linear models with fixed or growing dimension and series approximation models. We prove that the proposed procedure does not sacrifice any statistical inferential accuracy provided that the number of distributed computing units and quantile levels are chosen properly. In particular, a sharp upper bound for the former and a sharp lower bound for the latter are derived to capture the minimal computational cost from a statistical perspective. As an important application, the statistical inference on conditional distribution functions is considered. Moreover, we propose computationally efficient approaches to conducting inference in the distributed estimation setting described above. Those approaches directly utilize the availability of estimators from sub-samples and can be carried out at almost no additional computational cost. Simulations confirm our statistical inferential theory.},

To this end, the simple setting of bounded response variable and bounded (high-dimensional) covariates is considered. We propose some new adaptations of the lasso to these settings and establish oracle inequalities both in expectation and in deviation. These results provide non-asymptotic upper bounds on the risk that highlight the interplay between the bias due to the mis-specification of the linear model, the bias due to the approximate sparsity and the variance.

  title       = {Double/Debiased Machine Learning for Treatment and Causal Parameters},
  abstract    = {Most modern supervised statistical/machine learning (ML) methods are explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be called a "double ML" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting. This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of these methods.},

They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment term for first step estimation. Locally robust estimators have several advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in the first step, see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the specification of the first step. They are doubly robust for affine moment functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one first step component is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is flatter as a function of first step smoothing leading to improved small sample properties. Series first step estimators confer local robustness on any moment conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, in the direction of the series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given here, including for economic structural models. We give simple asymptotic theory for estimators that use cross-fitting in the first step, including machine learning.},

We show that the $n^{-1/4}$ requirement can be improved to $n^{-1/(2k+2)}$ by employing a $k$-th order notion of orthogonality that grants robustness to more complex or higher-dimensional nuisance parameters. In the partially linear regression setting popular in causal inference, we show that we can construct second-order orthogonal moments if and only if the treatment residual is not normally distributed. Our proof relies on Stein's lemma and may be of independent interest. We conclude by demonstrating the robustness benefits of an explicit doubly-orthogonal estimation procedure for treatment effect.},

However, the reasons for these differences, and their effect on the underlying loss landscape, is not well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range of visualization methods. First, we introduce a simple "filter normalization" method that helps us visualize loss function curvature, and make meaningful side-by-side comp arisons between loss functions.

For previously unseen examples, the approach is guaranteed to detect all adversarial examples, though it may flag some non-adversarial examples as well. The basic idea is to consider a convex outer approximation of the set of activations reachable through a norm-bounded perturbation, and we develop a robust optimization procedure that minimizes the worst case loss over this outer region (via a linear program). Crucially, we show that the dual problem to this linear program can be represented itself as a deep network similar to the backpropagation network, leading to very efficient optimization approaches that produce guaranteed bounds on the robust loss. The end result is that by executing a few more forward and backward passes through a slightly modified version of the original network (though possibly with much larger batch sizes), we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a number of tasks to train classifiers with robust adversarial guarantees (e.g. for MNIST, we produce a convolutional classifier that provably has less than 5.8% test error for any adversarial attack with bounded $\ell_\infty$ norm less than $\epsilon = 0.1$).

The primary challenge in this domain is finding a way to represent, or encode, graph structure so that it can be easily exploited by machine learning models. Traditionally, machine learning approaches relied on user-defined heuristics to extract features encoding structural information about a graph (e.g., degree statistics or kernel functions). However, recent years have seen a surge in approaches that automatically learn to encode graph structure into low-dimensional embeddings, using techniques based on deep learning and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Here we provide a conceptual review of key advancements in this area of representation learning on graphs, including matrix factorization-based methods, random-walk based algorithms, and graph neural networks. We review methods to embed individual nodes as well as approaches to embed entire (sub)graphs. In doing so, we develop a unified framework to describe these recent approaches, and we highlight a number of important applications and directions for future work.},

  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {We study asymptotically normal estimation and confidence regions for low-dimensional parameters in high-dimensional sparse models. Our approach is based on the $\ell_1$-penalized M-estimator which is used for construction of a bias corrected estimator. We show that the proposed estimator is asymptotically normal, under a sparsity assumption on the high-dimensional parameter, smoothness conditions on the expected loss and an entropy condition. This leads to uniformly valid confidence regions and hypothesis testing for low-dimensional parameters. The present approach is different in that it allows for treatment of loss functions that we not sufficiently differentiable, such as quantile loss, Huber loss or hinge loss functions. We also provide new results for estimation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, which is necessary for the construction of the proposed estimator. We formulate our results for general models under high-level conditions, but investigate these conditions in detail for generalized linear models and provide mild sufficient conditions. As particular examples, we investigate the case of quantile loss and Huber loss in linear regression and demonstrate the performance of the estimators in a simulation study and on real datasets from genome-wide association studies. We further investigate the case of logistic regression and illustrate the performance of the estimator on simulated and real data.},

Moreover, to handle score functions and response variables that are heavy-tailed, our estimators are constructed via carefully thresholding their empirical counterparts. We show that our estimator achieves near- optimal statistical rate of convergence in several settings. We supplement our theoretical results via simulation experiments that confirm the theory.},

It generalizes Gaussian graphical models to a wide range of continuous, discrete, and combinations of different types of data. We also show that the models in the framework, called exponential trace models, are amenable to efficient estimation and inference based on maximum likelihood. As a consequence, we expect applications to a large variety of multivariate data that have correlated coordinates.},

  abstract    = {In applications of graphical models, we typically have more information than just the samples themselves. A prime example is the estimation of brain connectivity networks based on fMRI data, where in addition to the samples themselves, the spatial positions of the measurements are readily available. With particular regard for this application, we are thus interested in ways to incorporate additional knowledge most effectively into graph estimation. Our approach to this is to make neighborhood selection receptive to additional knowledge by strengthening the role of the tuning parameters. We demonstrate that this concept (i) can improve reproducibility, (ii) is computationally convenient and efficient, and (iii) carries a lucid Bayesian interpretation. We specifically show that the approach provides effective estimations of brain connectivity graphs from fMRI data. However, providing a general scheme for the inclusion of additional knowledge, our concept is expected to have applications in a wide range of domains.},

  abstract    = {We present a novel k-way high-dimensional graphical model called the Generalized Root Model (GRM) that explicitly models dependencies between variable sets of size k > 2---where k = 2 is the standard pairwise graphical model. This model is based on taking the k-th root of the original sufficient statistics of any univariate exponential family with positive sufficient statistics, including the Poisson and exponential distributions. As in the recent work with square root graphical (SQR) models [Inouye et al. 2016]---which was restricted to pairwise dependencies---we give the conditions of the parameters that are needed for normalization using the radial conditionals similar to the pairwise case [Inouye et al. 2016]. In particular, we show that the Poisson GRM has no restrictions on the parameters and the exponential GRM only has a restriction akin to negative definiteness. We develop a simple but general learning algorithm based on L1-regularized node-wise regressions. We also present a general way of numerically approximating the log partition function and associated derivatives of the GRM univariate node conditionals---in contrast to [Inouye et al. 2016], which only provided algorithm for estimating the exponential SQR. To illustrate GRM, we model word counts with a Poisson GRM and show the associated k-sized variable sets. We finish by discussing methods for reducing the parameter space in various situations.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents a framework for computing random operator-valued feature maps for operator-valued positive definite kernels. This is a generalization of the random Fourier features for scalar-valued kernels to the operator-valued case. Our general setting is that of operator-valued kernels corresponding to RKHS of functions with values in a Hilbert space. We show that in general, for a given kernel, there are potentially infinitely many random feature maps, which can be bounded or unbounded. Most importantly, given a kernel, we present a general, closed form formula for computing a corresponding probability measure, which is required for the construction of the Fourier features, and which, unlike the scalar case, is not uniquely and automatically determined by the kernel. We also show that, under appropriate conditions, random bounded feature maps can always be computed. Furthermore, we show the uniform convergence, under the Hilbert-Schmidt norm, of the resulting approximate kernel to the exact kernel on any compact subset of Euclidean space. Our convergence requires differentiable kernels, an improvement over the twice-differentiability requirement in previous work in the scalar setting. We then show how operator-valued feature maps and their approximations can be employed in a general vector-valued learning framework. The mathematical formulation is illustrated by numerical examples on matrix-valued kernels.},

  abstract    = {The rapid development of high-throughput technologies has enabled the generation of data from biological or disease processes that span multiple layers, like genomic, proteomic or metabolomic data, and further pertain to multiple sources, like disease subtypes or experimental conditions. In this work, we propose a general statistical framework based on Gaussian graphical models for horizontal (i.e. across conditions or subtypes) and vertical (i.e. across different layers containing data on molecular compartments) integration of information in such datasets. We start with decomposing the multi-layer problem into a series of two-layer problems. For each two-layer problem, we model the outcomes at a node in the lower layer as dependent on those of other nodes in that layer, as well as all nodes in the upper layer. We use a combination of neighborhood selection and group-penalized regression to obtain sparse estimates of all model parameters. Following this, we develop a debiasing technique and asymptotic distributions of inter-layer directed edge weights that utilize already computed neighborhood selection coefficients for nodes in the upper layer. Subsequently, we establish global and simultaneous testing procedures for these edge weights. Performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated on synthetic data.},

  abstract    = {Training neural networks is a challenging non-convex optimization problem, and backpropagation or gradient descent can get stuck in spurious local optima. We propose a novel algorithm based on tensor decomposition for guaranteed training of two-layer neural networks. We provide risk bounds for our proposed method, with a polynomial sample complexity in the relevant parameters, such as input dimension and number of neurons. While learning arbitrary target functions is NP-hard, we provide transparent conditions on the function and the input for learnability. Our training method is based on tensor decomposition, which provably converges to the global optimum, under a set of mild non-degeneracy conditions. It consists of simple embarrassingly parallel linear and multi-linear operations, and is competitive with standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD), in terms of computational complexity. Thus, we propose a computationally efficient method with guaranteed risk bounds for training neural networks with one hidden layer.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {This paper is concerned with finite sample approximations to the supremum of a non-degenerate $U$-process of a general order indexed by a function class. We are primarily interested in situations where the function class as well as the underlying distribution change with the sample size, and the $U$-process itself is not weakly convergent as a process. Such situations arise in a variety of modern statistical problems. We first consider Gaussian approximations, namely, approximate the $U$-process supremum by the supremum of a Gaussian process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds. Such Gaussian approximations are, however, not often directly usable in statistical problems since the covariance function of the approximating Gaussian process is unknown. This motivates us to study bootstrap-type approximations to the $U$-process supremum. We propose a novel jackknife multiplier bootstrap (JMB) tailored to the $U$-process, and derive coupling and Kolmogorov distance bounds for the proposed JMB method. All these results are non-asymptotic, and established under fairly general conditions on function classes and underlying distributions. Key technical tools in the proofs are new local maximal inequalities for $U$-processes, which may be useful in other contexts. We also discuss applications of the general approximation results to testing for qualitative features of nonparametric functions based on generalized local $U$-processes.},

  abstract    = {This paper studies inference for the mean vector of a high-dimensional $U$-statistic. In the era of Big Data, the dimension $d$ of the $U$-statistic and the sample size $n$ of the observations tend to be both large, and the computation of the $U$-statistic is prohibitively demanding. Data-dependent inferential procedures such as the empirical bootstrap for $U$-statistics is even more computationally expensive. To overcome such computational bottleneck, incomplete $U$-statistics obtained by sampling fewer terms of the $U$-statistic are attractive alternatives. In this paper, we introduce randomized incomplete $U$-statistics with sparse weights whose computational cost can be made independent of the order of the $U$-statistic. We derive non-asymptotic Gaussian approximation error bounds for the randomized incomplete $U$-statistics in high dimensions, namely in cases where the dimension $d$ is possibly much larger than the sample size $n$, for both non-degenerate and degenerate kernels. In addition, we propose generic bootstrap methods for the incomplete $U$-statistics that are computationally much less-demanding than existing bootstrap methods, and establish finite sample validity of the proposed bootstrap methods. Our methods are illustrated on the application to nonparametric testing for the pairwise independence of a high-dimensional random vector under weaker assumptions than those appearing in the literature.},

High-dimensional models are characterized by having a number of unknown parameters that is not vanishingly small relative to the sample size.

Within this context, we review fundamental results including high-dimensional central limit theorems, bootstrap approximation of high-dimensional limit distributions, and moderate deviation theory. We also review key concepts underlying inference when many parameters are of interest such as multiple testing with family-wise error rate or false discovery rate control. We then turn to a general high-dimensional minimum distance framework with a special focus on generalized method of moments problems where we present results for estimation and inference about model parameters. The presented results cover a wide array of econometric applications, and we discuss several leading special cases including high-dimensional linear regression and linear instrumental variables models to illustrate the general results.},

  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {In recent years, bootstrap methods have drawn attention for their ability to approximate the laws of "max statistics" in high-dimensional problems. A leading example of such a statistic is the coordinate-wise maximum of a sample average of $n$ random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^p$. Existing results for this statistic show that the bootstrap can work when $n\ll p$, and rates of approximation (in Kolmogorov distance) have been obtained with only logarithmic dependence in $p$. Nevertheless, one of the challenging aspects of this setting is that established rates tend to scale like $n^{-1/6}$ as a function of $n$. The main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that improvement in rate is possible when extra model structure is available. Specifically, we show that if the coordinate-wise variances of the observations exhibit decay, then a nearly $n^{-1/2}$ rate can be achieved, independent of $p$. Furthermore, a surprising aspect of this dimension-free rate is that it holds even when the decay is very weak. As a numerical illustration, we show how these ideas can be used in the context of functional data analysis to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for the Fourier coefficients of a mean function.},

For instance, in epidemiology and clinical research, strata are often defined according to age, gender, treatment or disease type, etc. In this article, we propose new approaches aimed at estimating binary graphical models on such strata. Our approaches are obtained by combining well-known methods when estimating one single binary graphical model, with penalties encouraging structured sparsity, and which have recently been shown appropriate when dealing with stratified data. Empirical comparions on synthetic data highlight that our approaches generally outperform the competitors we considered.

  abstract    = {This paper discusses a semiparametric single-index model. The link function is allowed to be unbounded and has unbounded support that fill the gap in the literature. The link function is treated as a point in an infinitely many dimensional function space which enables us to derive the estimates for the index parameter and the link function simultaneously. This approach is different from the profile method commonly used in the literature. The estimator is derived from an optimization with the constraint of an identification condition for the index parameter, which solves an important problem in the literature of single-index models. In addition, making use of a property of Hermite orthogonal polynomials, an explicit estimator for the index parameter is obtained. Asymptotic properties of the two estimators of the index parameter are established. Their efficiency is discussed in some special cases as well. The finite sample properties of the two estimators are demonstrated through an extensive Monte Carlo study and an empirical example.},

  abstract    = {Software for computation of maximum likelihood estimates in linear structural equation models typically employs general techniques from non-linear optimization, such as quasi-Newton methods. In practice, careful tuning of initial values is often required to avoid convergence issues. As an alternative approach, we propose a block-coordinate descent method that cycles through the considered variables, updating only the parameters related to a given variable in each step. We show that the resulting block update problems can be solved in closed form even when the structural equation model comprises feedback cycles. Furthermore, we give a characterization of the models for which the block-coordinate descent algorithm is well-defined, meaning that for generic data and starting values all block optimization problems admit a unique solution. For the characterization, we represent each model by its mixed graph (also known as path diagram), which leads to criteria that can be checked in time that is polynomial in the number of considered variables.},

In this paper, we consider the minimax rate of estimating the central space of the multiple index models $y=f(\beta_{1}^{\tau}x,\beta_{2}^{\tau}x,...,\beta_{d}^{\tau}x,\epsilon)$ with at most $s$ active predictors where $x \sim N(0,I_{p})$. We first introduce a large class of models depending on the smallest non-zero eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $var(\mathbb{E}[x|y])$, over which we show that an aggregated estimator based on the SIR procedure converges at rate $d\wedge((sd+s\log(ep/s))/(n\lambda))$. We then show that this rate is optimal in two scenarios: the single index models; and the multiple index models with fixed central dimension $d$ and fixed $\lambda$. By assuming a technical conjecture, we can show that this rate is also optimal for multiple index models with bounded dimension of the central space. We believe that these (conditional) optimal rate results bring us meaningful insights of general SDR problems in high dimensions.},

Typical learning  approaches such as expectation maximization (EM) or variational Bayes  can get stuck in spurious local optima. In contrast,  we present a tensor decomposition method which is guaranteed to correctly recover the parameters. The key insight is to employ certain feature transformations of the input, which depend on the input generative model. Specifically, we employ score function tensors of the input  and compute their cross-correlation with the response variable.   We establish that the decomposition of this tensor consistently recovers the parameters, under mild non-degeneracy conditions.  We demonstrate that the computational and  sample complexity of our method is a low order polynomial of the input and the latent  dimensions.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {Sliced inverse regression (SIR) is the most widely-used sufficient dimension reduction method due to its simplicity, generality and computational efficiency. However, when the distribution of the covariates deviates from the multivariate normal distribution, the estimation efficiency of SIR is rather low. In this paper, we propose a robust alternative to SIR - called elliptical sliced inverse regression (ESIR) for analysing high dimensional, elliptically distributed data. There are wide range of applications of the elliptically distributed data, especially in finance and economics where the distribution of the data is often heavy-tailed. To tackle the heavy-tailed elliptically distributed covariates, we novelly utilize the multivariate Kendall's tau matrix in a framework of so-called generalized eigenvector problem for sufficient dimension reduction. Methodologically, we present a practical algorithm for our method. Theoretically, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the ESIR estimator and obtain the corresponding convergence rate under high dimensional setting. Quantities of simulation results show that ESIR significantly improves the estimation efficiency in heavy-tailed scenarios. A stock exchange data analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. Moreover, ESIR can be easily extended to most other sufficient dimension reduction methods.},

  abstract    = {Many modern machine learning models are trained to achieve zero or near-zero training error in order to obtain near-optimal (but non-zero) test error. This phenomenon of strong generalization performance for "overfitted" / interpolated classifiers appears to be ubiquitous in high-dimensional data, having been observed in deep networks, kernel machines, boosting and random forests. Their performance is robust even when the data contain large amounts of label noise. Very little theory is available to explain these observations. The vast majority of theoretical analyses of generalization allows for interpolation only when there is little or no label noise. This paper takes a step toward a theoretical foundation for interpolated classifiers by analyzing local interpolating schemes, including geometric simplicial interpolation algorithm and weighted $k$-nearest neighbor schemes. Consistency or near-consistency is proved for these schemes in classification and regression problems. These schemes have an inductive bias that benefits from higher dimension, a kind of "blessing of dimensionality". Finally, connections to kernel machines, random forests, and adversarial examples in the interpolated regime are discussed.},

  abstract    = {Latent space models are effective tools for statistical modeling and exploration of network data. These models can effectively model real world network characteristics such as degree heterogeneity, transitivity, homophily, etc. Due to their close connection to generalized linear models, it is also natural to incorporate covariate information in them. The current paper presents two universal fitting algorithms for networks with edge covariates: one based on nuclear norm penalization and the other based on projected gradient descent. Both algorithms are motivated by maximizing likelihood for a special class of inner-product models while working simultaneously for a wide range of different latent space models, such as distance models, which allow latent vectors to affect edge formation in flexible ways. These fitting methods, especially the one based on projected gradient descent, are fast and scalable to large networks. We obtain their rates of convergence for both inner-product models and beyond. The effectiveness of the modeling approach and fitting algorithms is demonstrated on five real world network datasets for different statistical tasks, including community detection with and without edge covariates, and network assisted learning.},

Towards explaining this phenomenon, we adopt a margin-based perspective. We establish: 1) for multi-layer feedforward relu networks, the global minimizer of a weakly-regularized cross-entropy loss has the maximum normalized margin among all networks, 2) as a result, increasing the over-parametrization improves the normalized margin and generalization error bounds for two-layer networks. In particular, an infinite-size neural network enjoys the best generalization guarantees. The typical infinite feature methods are kernel methods; we compare the neural net margin with that of kernel methods and construct natural instances where kernel methods have much weaker generalization guarantees. We validate this gap between the two approaches empirically. Finally, this infinite-neuron viewpoint is also fruitful for analyzing optimization. We show that a perturbed gradient flow on infinite-size networks finds a global optimizer in polynomial time.},

  abstract    = {We consider strictly stationary stochastic processes of Hilbert space-valued random variables and focus on tests of the equality of the lag-zero autocovariance operators of several independent functional time series. A moving block bootstrap-based testing procedure is proposed which generates pseudo random elements that satisfy the null hypothesis of interest. It is based on directly bootstrapping the time series of tensor products which overcomes some common difficulties associated with applications of the bootstrap to related testing problems. The suggested methodology can be potentially applied to a broad range of test statistics of the hypotheses of interest. As an example, we establish validity for approximating the distribution under the null of a fully functional test statistic based on the Hilbert-Schmidt distance of the corresponding sample lag-zero autocovariance operators, and show consistency under the alternative. As a prerequisite, we prove a central limit theorem for the moving block bootstrap procedure applied to the sample autocovariance operator which is of interest on its own. The finite sample size and power performance of the suggested moving block bootstrap-based testing procedure is illustrated through simulations and an application to a real-life dataset is discussed.},

  journal     = {arxiv},
  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {It is a common saying that testing for conditional independence, i.e., testing whether X is independent of Y, given Z, is a hard statistical problem if Z is a continuous random variable. In this paper, we prove that conditional independence is indeed a particularly difficult hypothesis to test for. Statistical tests are required to have a size that is smaller than a predefined significance level, and different tests usually have power against a different class of alternatives. We prove that a valid test for conditional independence does not have power against any alternative. Given the non-existence of a uniformly valid conditional independence test, we argue that tests must be designed so their suitability for a particular problem setting may be judged easily. To address this need, we propose in the case where X and Y are univariate to nonlinearly regress X on Z, and Y on Z and then compute a test statistic based on the sample covariance between the residuals, which we call the generalised covariance measure (GCM). We prove that validity of this form of test relies almost entirely on the weak requirement that the regression procedures are able to estimate the conditional means X given Z, and Y given Z, at a slow rate. We extend the methodology to handle settings where X and Y may be multivariate or even high-dimensional. While our general procedure can be tailored to the setting at hand by combining it with any regression technique, we develop the theoretical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. A simulation study shows that the test based on GCM is competitive with state of the art conditional independence tests. Code will be available as an R package.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of recovering low-rank matrices from random rank-one measurements, which spans numerous applications including phase retrieval, quantum state tomography, and learning shallow neural networks with quadratic activations, among others. Our approach is to directly estimate the low-rank factor by minimizing a nonconvex least-squares loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following a tailored spectral initialization. When the true rank is small, this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth (up to global ambiguity) with near-optimal sample and computational complexities with respect to the problem size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee that achieves near optimality in both metrics. In particular, the key enabler of near-optimal computational guarantees is an implicit regularization phenomenon: without explicit regularization, both spectral initialization and the gradient descent iterates automatically stay within a region incoherent with the measurement vectors. This feature allows one to employ much more aggressive step sizes compared with the ones suggested in prior literature, without the need of sample splitting.},

  abstract      = {Probabilistic graphical models provide a flexible yet parsimonious framework for modeling dependencies among nodes in networks. There is a vast literature on parameter estimation and consistent model selection for graphical models. However, in many of the applications, scientists are also interested in quantifying the uncertainty associated with the estimated parameters and selected models, which current literature has not addressed thoroughly. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for statistical inference on edge parameters in pairwise graphical models based on generalized Hyvarinen scoring rule. Hyvarinen scoring rule is especially useful in cases where the normalizing constant cannot be obtained efficiently in a closed form, which is a common problem for graphical models, including Ising models and truncated Gaussian graphical models. Our estimator allows us to perform statistical inference for general graphical models whereas the existing works mostly focus on statistical inference for Gaussian graphical models where finding normalizing constant is computationally tractable. Under mild conditions that are typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation, we prove that our proposed estimator is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent and asymptotically normal, which allows us to construct confidence intervals and build hypothesis tests for edge parameters. Moreover, we show how our proposed method can be applied to test hypotheses that involve a large number of model parameters simultaneously. We illustrate validity of our estimator through extensive simulation studies on a diverse collection of data-generating processes.},

  abstract  = {Data collected from mobile phones have the potential to provide insight into the relational dynamics of individuals. This paper compares observational data from mobile phones with standard self-report survey data. We find that the information from these two data sources is overlapping but distinct. For example, self-reports of physical proximity deviate from mobile phone records depending on the recency and salience of the interactions. We also demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 95\% of friendships based on the observational data alone, where friend dyads demonstrate distinctive temporal and spatial patterns in their physical proximity and calling patterns. These behavioral patterns, in turn, allow the prediction of individual-level outcomes such as job satisfaction.},

Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm in terms of both parameter estimation and computational performance.},

  year        = {2018},
  abstract    = {The edge structure of the graph defining an undirected graphical model describes precisely the structure of dependence between the variables in the graph. In many applications, the dependence structure is unknown and it is desirable to learn it from data, often because it is a preliminary step to be able to ascertain causal effects. This problem, known as structure learning, is hard in general, but for Gaussian graphical models it is slightly easier because the structure of the graph is given by the sparsity pattern of the precision matrix of the joint distribution, and because independence coincides with decorrelation. A major difficulty too often ignored in structure learning is the fact that if some variables are not observed, the marginal dependence graph over the observed variables will possibly be significantly more complex and no longer reflect the direct dependencies that are potentially associated with causal effects. In this work, we consider a family of latent variable Gaussian graphical models in which the graph of the joint distribution between observed and unobserved variables is sparse, and the unobserved variables are conditionally independent given the others. Prior work was able to recover the connectivity between observed variables, but could only identify the subspace spanned by unobserved variables, whereas we propose a convex optimization formulation based on structured matrix sparsity to estimate the complete connectivity of the complete graph including unobserved variables, given the knowledge of the number of missing variables, and a priori knowledge of their level of connectivity. Our formulation is supported by a theoretical result of identifiability of the latent dependence structure for sparse graphs in the infinite data limit. We propose an algorithm leveraging recent active set methods, which performs well in the experiments on synthetic data.},

  title       = {Safe, Multi-Agent, Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving},
  year        = {2016},
  abstract    = {Autonomous driving is a multi-agent setting where the host vehicle must apply sophisticated negotiation skills with other road users when overtaking, giving way, merging, taking left and right turns and while pushing ahead in unstructured urban roadways. Since there are many possible scenarios, manually tackling all possible cases will likely yield a too simplistic policy. Moreover, one must balance between unexpected behavior of other drivers/pedestrians and at the same time not to be too defensive so that normal traffic flow is maintained. In this paper we apply deep reinforcement learning to the problem of forming long term driving strategies. We note that there are two major challenges that make autonomous driving different from other robotic tasks. First, is the necessity for ensuring functional safety - something that machine learning has difficulty with given that performance is optimized at the level of an expectation over many instances. Second, the Markov Decision Process model often used in robotics is problematic in our case because of unpredictable behavior of other agents in this multi-agent scenario. We make three contributions in our work. First, we show how policy gradient iterations can be used without Markovian assumptions. Second, we decompose the problem into a composition of a Policy for Desires (which is to be learned) and trajectory planning with hard constraints (which is not learned). The goal of Desires is to enable comfort of driving, while hard constraints guarantees the safety of driving. Third, we introduce a hierarchical temporal abstraction we call an "Option Graph" with a gating mechanism that significantly reduces the effective horizon and thereby reducing the variance of the gradient estimation even further.},

  abstract    = {Multi-agent reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a number of challenging problems. Despite these empirical successes, theoretical understanding of different algorithms is lacking, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential growth of the state-action space with the number of agents. We study a fundamental problem of multi-agent linear quadratic regulator in a setting where the agents are partially exchangeable. In this setting, we develop a hierarchical actor-critic algorithm, whose computational complexity is independent of the total number of agents, and prove its global linear convergence to the optimal policy. As linear quadratic regulators are often used to approximate general dynamic systems, this paper provided an important step towards better understanding of general hierarchical mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning.},

In this paper, we propose a new stochastic algorithm based on PRSM, prove its convergence rate in ergodic sense, and test its performance on both artificial and real data. We show that our proposed algorithm, Stochastic Scalable PRSM (SS-PRSM), enjoys the $O(1/K)$ convergence rate, which is the same as those newest stochastic algorithms that based on ADMM but faster than general Stochastic ADMM (which is $O(1/\sqrt{K})$). Our algorithm also owns wide flexibility, outperforms many state-of-the-art stochastic algorithms coming from ADMM, and has low memory cost in large-scale splitting optimization problems.},

Here for a given cascade, we only observe the times of infection for infected nodes but not the source of the infection. Most of the existing work on this problem has focused on estimating a diffusion matrix without any structural assumptions on it. In this paper, we propose a novel model based on the intuition that an information is more likely to propagate among two nodes if they are interested in similar topics which are also prominent in the information content. In particular, our model endows each node with an influence vector (which measures how authoritative the node is on each topic) and a receptivity vector (which measures how susceptible the node is for each topic). We show how this node-topic structure can be estimated from the observed cascades and prove an analytical upper bound on the estimation error. The estimated model can be used to build recommendation systems based on the receptivity vectors, as well as for marketing based on the influence vectors. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the improved performance and better interpretability of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract  = {Networks provide a natural yet statistically grounded way to depict and understand how a set of entities interact. However, in many situations interactions are not directly observed and the network needs to be reconstructed based on observations collected for each entity. Our work focuses on the situation where these observations consist of counts. A typical example is the reconstruction of an ecological network based on abundance data. In this setting, the abundance of a set of species is collected in a series of samples and/or environments and we aim at inferring direct interactions between the species. The abundances at hand can be, for example, direct counts of individuals (ecology of macro-organisms) or read counts resulting from metagenomic sequencing (microbial ecology). Whatever the approach chosen to infer such a network, it has to account for the peculiaraties of the data at hand. The first, obvious one, is that the data are counts, i.e. non continuous. Also, the observed counts often vary over many orders of magnitude and are more dispersed than expected under a simple model, such as the Poisson distribution. The observed counts may also result from different sampling efforts in each sample and/or for each entity, which hampers direct comparison. Furthermore, because the network is supposed to reveal only direct interactions, it is highly desirable to account for covariates describing the environment to avoid spurious edges. Many methods of network reconstruction from count data have been proposed. In the context of microbial ecology, most methods (SparCC, REBACCA, SPIEC-EASI, gCODA, BanOCC) rely on a two-step strategy: transform the counts to pseudo Gaussian observations using simple transforms before moving back to the setting of Gaussian Graphical Models, for which state of the art methods exist to infer the network, but only in a Gaussian world. In this work, we consider instead a full-fledged probabilistic model with a latent layer where the counts follow Poisson distributions, conditional to latent (hidden) Gaussian correlated variables. In this model, known as Poisson log-normal (PLN), the dependency structure is completely captured by the latent layer and we model counts, rather than transformations thereof. To our knowledge, the PLN framework is quite new and has only been used by two other recent methods (Mint and plnDAG) to reconstruct networks from count data. In this work, we use the same mathematical framework but adopt a different optimization strategy which alleviates the whole optimization process. We also fully exploit the connection between the PLN framework and generalized linear models to account for the peculiarities of microbiological data sets. The network inference step is done as usual by adding sparsity inducing constraints on the inverse covariance matrix of the latent Gaussian vector to select only the most important interactions between species. Unlike the usual Gaussian setting, the penalized likelihood is generally not tractable in this framework. We resort instead to a variational approximation for parameter inference and solve the corresponding optimization problem by alternating a gradient descent on the variational parameters and a graphical-Lasso step on the covariance matrix. We also select the sparsity parameter using the resampling-based StARS procedure. We show that the sparse PLN approach has better performance than existing methods on simulated datasets and that it extracts relevant signal from microbial ecology datasets. We also show that the inference scales to datasets made up of hundred of species and samples, in line with other methods in the field. In short, our contributions to the field are the following: we extend the use of PLN distributions in network inference by (i) accounting for covariates and offset and thus removing some spurious edges induced by confounding factors, (ii) accounting for different sampling effort to integrate data sets from different sources and thus infer interactions between different types of organisms (e.g. bacteria - fungi), (iii) developing an inference procedure based on the iterative optimization of a well defined objective function. Our objective function is a provable lower bound of the observed likelihood and our procedure accounts for the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the latent variable, unlike the algorithm presented in Mint and plnDAG.},

  abstract    = {Quantile regression has been successfully used to study heterogeneous and heavy-tailed data. Varying-coefficient models are frequently used to capture changes in the effect of input variables on the response as a function of an index or time. In this work, we study high-dimensional varying-coefficient quantile regression models and develop new tools for statistical inference. We focus on development of valid confidence intervals and honest tests for nonparametric coefficients at a fixed time point and quantile, while allowing for a high-dimensional setting where the number of input variables exceeds the sample size. Performing statistical inference in this regime is challenging due to the usage of model selection techniques in estimation. Nevertheless, we can develop valid inferential tools that are applicable to a wide range of data generating processes and do not suffer from biases introduced by model selection. We performed numerical simulations to demonstrate the finite sample performance of our method, and we also illustrated the application with a real data example.},

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the ratio between two posterior probability density functions of a latent variable. Particularly, we assume the posterior ratio function can be well-approximated by a parametric model, which is then estimated using observed datasets and synthetic prior samples. We prove consistency of our estimator and the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters as the number of prior samples tending to infinity. Finally, we validate our theories using numerical experiments and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method through some real-world applications.},

However, in many problems, there are natural constraints on model parameters and one is interested in whether the parameters are on the boundary of the constraint or not. e.g. non-negativity constraints for transmission rates in network diffusion. In this paper, we provide algorithms to solve this problem of hypothesis testing in high-dimensional statistical models under constrained parameter space. We show that following our testing procedure we are able to get asymptotic designed Type I error under the null. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has greater power than the standard algorithms where the constraints are ignored. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms on two real datasets where we have {\emph{intrinsic}} constraint on the parameters.},

We consider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem as a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric exponential family distribution: the bipartite graph is assumed to be generated by a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component is given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks that take high-dimensional features as inputs, while nonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. In this setting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the weight matrices, and the main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity of activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the distribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood objective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a neighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method achieves linear convergence rate. Moreover, we prove that the sample complexity of the problem is linear in dimensions (up to logarithmic factors), which is consistent with parametric Gaussian models. However, our estimator is robust to any model misspecification within the exponential family, which is validated in extensive experiments.},

  abstract    = {We develop a new modeling framework for Inter-Subject Analysis (ISA). The goal of ISA is to explore the dependency structure between different subjects with the intra-subject dependency as nuisance. It has important applications in neuroscience to explore the functional connectivity between brain regions under natural stimuli. Our framework is based on the Gaussian graphical models, under which ISA can be converted to the problem of estimation and inference of the inter-subject precision matrix. The main statistical challenge is that we do not impose sparsity constraint on the whole precision matrix and we only assume the inter-subject part is sparse. For estimation, we propose to estimate an alternative parameter to get around the non-sparse issue and it can achieve asymptotic consistency even if the intra-subject dependency is dense. For inference, we propose an "untangle and chord" procedure to de-bias our estimator. It is valid without the sparsity assumption on the inverse Hessian of the log-likelihood function. This inferential method is general and can be applied to many other statistical problems, thus it is of independent theoretical interest. Numerical experiments on both simulated and brain imaging data validate our methods and theory.},

While evaluating the uncertainty of the network estimates is critical in scientific applications, existing methodological and theoretical work has primarily addressed estimation. To bridge this gap, this paper develops a new statistical inference procedure for high-dimensional Hawkes processes. The key ingredient for this inference procedure is a new concentration inequality on the first- and second-order statistics for integrated stochastic processes, which summarize the entire history of the process. Combining recent results on martingale central limit theory with the new concentration inequality, we then characterize the convergence rate of the test statistics. We illustrate finite sample validity of our inferential tools via extensive simulations and demonstrate their utility by applying them to a neuron spike train data set.},

Trustworthy AI ups the ante on both trustworthy computing and formal methods.},

  abstract    = {Artificial intelligence (AI) provides many opportunities to improve private and public life. Discovering patterns and structures in large troves of data in an automated manner is a core component of data science, and currently drives applications in diverse areas such as computational biology, law and finance. However, such a highly positive impact is coupled with significant challenges: how do we understand the decisions suggested by these systems in order that we can trust them? In this report, we focus specifically on data-driven methods -- machine learning (ML) and pattern recognition models in particular -- so as to survey and distill the results and observations from the literature. The purpose of this report can be especially appreciated by noting that ML models are increasingly deployed in a wide range of businesses. However, with the increasing prevalence and complexity of methods, business stakeholders in the very least have a growing number of concerns about the drawbacks of models, data-specific biases, and so on. Analogously, data science practitioners are often not aware about approaches emerging from the academic literature, or may struggle to appreciate the differences between different methods, so end up using industry standards such as SHAP. Here, we have undertaken a survey to help industry practitioners (but also data scientists more broadly) understand the field of explainable machine learning better and apply the right tools. Our latter sections build a narrative around a putative data scientist, and discuss how she might go about explaining her models by asking the right questions.},

  title       = {Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated},
  abstract    = {Deep neural network (DNN) is an indispensable machine learning tool for achieving human-level performance on many learning tasks. Yet, due to its black-box nature, it is inherently difficult to understand which aspects of the input data drive the decisions of the network. There are various real-world scenarios in which humans need to make actionable decisions based on the output DNNs. Such decision support systems can be found in critical domains, such as legislation, law enforcement, etc. It is important that the humans making high-level decisions can be sure that the DNN decisions are driven by combinations of data features that are appropriate in the context of the deployment of the decision support system and that the decisions made are legally or ethically defensible. Due to the incredible pace at which DNN technology is being developed, the development of new methods and studies on explaining the decision-making process of DNNs has blossomed into an active research field. A practitioner beginning to study explainable deep learning may be intimidated by the plethora of orthogonal directions the field is taking. This complexity is further exacerbated by the general confusion that exists in defining what it means to be able to explain the actions of a deep learning system and to evaluate a system's "ability to explain". To alleviate this problem, this article offers a "field guide" to deep learning explainability for those uninitiated in the field. The field guide: i) Discusses the traits of a deep learning system that researchers enhance in explainability research, ii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iii) introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning. The guide is designed as an easy-to-digest starting point for those just embarking in the field.},

  abstract    = {We present a brief history of the field of interpretable machine learning (IML), give an overview of state-of-the-art interpretation methods, and discuss challenges. Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the social sciences.},

  abstract  = {The recent surge in interpretability research has led to confusion on numerous fronts. In particular, it is unclear what it means to be interpretable and how to select, evaluate, or even discuss methods for producing interpretations of machine-learning models. We aim to clarify these concerns by defining interpretable machine learning and constructing a unifying framework for existing methods which highlights the underappreciated role played by human audiences. Within this framework, methods are organized into 2 classes: model based and post hoc. To provide guidance in selecting and evaluating interpretation methods, we introduce 3 desiderata: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy. Using our framework, we review existing work, grounded in real-world studies which exemplify our desiderata, and suggest directions for future work.Machine-learning models have demonstrated great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions about unobserved data. In addition to using models for prediction, the ability to interpret what a model has learned is receiving an increasing amount of attention. However, this increased focus has led to considerable confusion about the notion of interpretability. In particular, it is unclear how the wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used to evaluate them. We aim to address these concerns by defining interpretability in the context of machine learning and introducing the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework for discussing interpretations. The PDR framework provides 3 overarching desiderata for evaluation: predictive accuracy, descriptive accuracy, and relevancy, with relevancy judged relative to a human audience. Moreover, to help manage the deluge of interpretation methods, we introduce a categorization of existing techniques into model-based and post hoc categories, with subgroups including sparsity, modularity, and simulatability. To demonstrate how practitioners can use the PDR framework to evaluate and understand interpretations, we provide numerous real-world examples. These examples highlight the often underappreciated role played by human audiences in discussions of interpretability. Finally, based on our framework, we discuss limitations of existing methods and directions for future work. We hope that this work will provide a common vocabulary that will make it easier for both practitioners and researchers to discuss and choose from the full range of interpretation methods.},

In the noiseless case, we provide matching upper and lower bounds on sample complexity for the exact recovery of sparse vectors and for stable estimation of approximately sparse vectors, respectively. In the noisy case, we develop upper and matching minimax lower bounds for estimation error. We also consider the debiased sparse group Lasso and investigate its asymptotic property for the purpose of statistical inference.

However, in observational data, actions are often confounded by unobserved variables. Instrumental variables (IVs), in the context of RL, are the variables whose influence on the state variables are all mediated through the action. When a valid instrument is present, we can recover the confounded transition dynamics through observational data. We study a confounded Markov decision process where the transition dynamics admit an additive nonlinear functional form. Using IVs, we derive a conditional moment restriction (CMR) through which we can identify transition dynamics based on observational data. We propose a provably efficient IV-aided Value Iteration (IVVI) algorithm based on a primal-dual reformulation of CMR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient algorithm for instrument-aided offline RL.},

We develop a universal optimization theory applicable to all convex personalized FL models in the literature. In particular, we propose a general personalized objective capable of recovering essentially any existing personalized FL objective as a special case. We design several optimization techniques to minimize the general objective, namely a tailored variant of Local SGD and variants of accelerated coordinate descent/accelerated SVRCD. We demonstrate the practicality and/or optimality of our methods both in terms of communication and local computation. Lastly, we argue about the implications of our general optimization theory when applied to solve specific personalized FL objectives.},

However, several recent works addressing non-convex constraints have only focused on simple models such as logistic regression or support vector machines. Neural networks, one of the most popular models for classification nowadays, are precluded and lack theoretical guarantees. In this work, we show that overparameterized neural networks could achieve a near-optimal and near-feasible solution of non-convex constrained optimization problems via the project stochastic gradient descent. Our key ingredient is the no-regret analysis of online learning for neural networks in the overparameterization regime, which may be of independent interest in online learning applications.},

  abstract      = {Undirected graphical models have been widely used to model the conditional independence structure of high-dimensional random vector data for years. In many modern applications such as EEG and fMRI data, the observations are multivariate random functions rather than scalars. To model the conditional independence of this type of data, functional graphical models are proposed and have attracted an increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood selection approach to estimate Gaussian functional graphical models. We first estimate the neighborhood of all nodes via function-on-function regression, and then we can recover the whole graph structure based on the neighborhood information. By estimating conditional structure directly, we can circumvent the need of a well-defined precision operator which generally does not exist. Besides, we can better explore the effect of the choice of function basis for dimension reduction. We give a criterion for choosing the best function basis and motivate two practically useful choices, which we justified by both theory and experiments and show that they are better than expanding each function onto its own FPCA basis as in previous literature. In addition, the neighborhood selection approach is computationally more efficient than fglasso as it is more easy to do parallel computing. The statistical consistency of our proposed methods in high-dimensional setting are supported by both theory and experiment.},

  abstract      = {Quantile regression is a powerful tool for learning the relationship between a response variable and a multivariate predictor while exploring heterogeneous effects. In this paper, we consider statistical inference for quantile regression with large-scale data in the "increasing dimension" regime. We provide a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a convolution-type smoothing approach that achieves adequate approximation to computation and inference for quantile regression. This method, which we refer to as {\it{conquer}}, turns the non-differentiable quantile loss function into a twice-differentiable, convex and locally strongly convex surrogate, which admits a fast and scalable Barzilai-Borwein gradient-based algorithm to perform optimization, and multiplier bootstrap for statistical inference. Theoretically, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on both estimation and Bahadur-Kiefer linearization errors, from which we show that the asymptotic normality of the conquer estimator holds under a weaker requirement on the number of the regressors than needed for conventional quantile regression. Moreover, we prove the validity of multiplier bootstrap confidence constructions. Our numerical studies confirm the conquer estimator as a practical and reliable approach to large-scale inference for quantile regression. Software implementing the methodology is available in the \texttt{R} package \texttt{conquer}.},

We propose an active-set stochastic sequential quadratic programming algorithm, using a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian as the merit function. The algorithm adaptively selects the penalty parameters of augmented Lagrangian and performs stochastic line search to decide the stepsize. The global convergence is established: for any initialization, the "liminf" of the KKT residuals converges to zero almost surely. Our algorithm and analysis further develop the prior work \cite{Na2021Adaptive} by allowing nonlinear inequality constraints.

  abstract      = {We propose a fast temporal decomposition procedure for solving long-horizon nonlinear dynamic programs. The core of the procedure is sequential quadratic programming (SQP), with a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian being the merit function. Within each SQP iteration, we solve the Newton system approximately using an overlapping temporal decomposition. We show that the approximated search direction is still a descent direction of the augmented Lagrangian, provided the overlap size and penalty parameters are suitably chosen, which allows us to establish global convergence. Moreover, we show that a unit stepsize is accepted locally for the approximated search direction, and further establish a uniform, local linear convergence over stages. Our local convergence rate matches the rate of the recent Schwarz scheme \cite{Na2020Overlapping}. However, the Schwarz scheme has to solve nonlinear subproblems to optimality in each iteration, while we only perform one Newton step instead. Numerical experiments validate our theories and demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

  abstract = {Abstract Graphs representing complex systems often share a partial underlying structure across domains while retaining individual features. Thus, identifying common structures can shed light on the underlying signal, for instance, when applied to scientific discovery or clinical diagnoses. Furthermore, growing evidence shows that the shared structure across domains boosts the estimation power of graphs, particularly for high-dimensional data. However, building a joint estimator to extract the common structure may be more complicated than it seems, most often due to data heterogeneity across sources.

  abstract      = {In federated learning (FL) problems, client sampling plays a key role in the convergence speed of training algorithm. However, while being an important problem in FL, client sampling is lack of study. In this paper, we propose an online learning with bandit feedback framework to understand the client sampling problem in FL. By adapting an Online Stochastic Mirror Descent algorithm to minimize the variance of gradient estimation, we propose a new adaptive client sampling algorithm. Besides, we use online ensemble method and doubling trick to automatically choose the tuning parameters in the algorithm. Theoretically, we show dynamic regret bound with comparator as the theoretically optimal sampling sequence; we also include the total variation of this sequence in our upper bound, which is a natural measure of the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, these theoretical contributions are novel to existing literature. Moreover, by implementing both synthetic and real data experiments, we show empirical evidence of the advantages of our proposed algorithms over widely-used uniform sampling and also other online learning based sampling strategies in previous studies. We also examine its robustness to the choice of tuning parameters. Finally, we discuss its possible extension to sampling without replacement and personalized FL objective. While the original goal is to solve client sampling problem, this work has more general applications on stochastic gradient descent and stochastic coordinate descent methods.},

  abstract      = {We study the convergence of accelerated stochastic gradient descent for strongly convex objectives under the growth condition, which states that the variance of stochastic gradient is bounded by a multiplicative part that grows with the full gradient, and a constant additive part. Through the lens of the growth condition, we investigate four widely used accelerated methods: Nesterov's accelerated method (NAM), robust momentum method (RMM), accelerated dual averaging method (ADAM), and implicit ADAM (iADAM). While these methods are known to improve the convergence rate of SGD under the condition that the stochastic gradient has bounded variance, it is not well understood how their convergence rates are affected by the multiplicative noise. In this paper, we show that these methods all converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with accelerated convergence rates (compared to SGD) even under the growth condition. In particular, NAM, RMM, iADAM enjoy acceleration only with a mild multiplicative noise, while ADAM enjoys acceleration even with a large multiplicative noise. Furthermore, we propose a generic tail-averaged scheme that allows the accelerated rates of ADAM and iADAM to nearly attain the theoretical lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor in the variance term).},

  abstract      = {Federated learning (FL) is a rapidly growing research field in machine learning. However, existing FL libraries cannot adequately support diverse algorithmic development; inconsistent dataset and model usage make fair algorithm comparison challenging. In this work, we introduce FedML, an open research library and benchmark to facilitate FL algorithm development and fair performance comparison. FedML supports three computing paradigms: on-device training for edge devices, distributed computing, and single-machine simulation. FedML also promotes diverse algorithmic research with flexible and generic API design and comprehensive reference baseline implementations (optimizer, models, and datasets). We hope FedML could provide an efficient and reproducible means for developing and evaluating FL algorithms that would benefit the FL research community. We maintain the source code, documents, and user community at https://fedml.ai.},

  abstract      = {We present a temporal decomposition scheme for solving long-horizon optimal control problems. In the proposed scheme, the time domain is decomposed into a set of subdomains with partially overlapping regions. Subproblems associated with the subdomains are solved in parallel to obtain local primal-dual trajectories that are assembled to obtain the global trajectories. We provide a sufficient condition that guarantees convergence of the proposed scheme. This condition states that the effect of perturbations on the boundary conditions (i.e., initial state and terminal dual/adjoint variable) should decay asymptotically as one moves away from the boundaries. This condition also reveals that the scheme converges if the size of the overlap is sufficiently large and that the convergence rate improves with the size of the overlap. We prove that linear quadratic problems satisfy the asymptotic decay condition, and we discuss numerical strategies to determine if the condition holds in more general cases. We draw upon a non-convex optimal control problem to illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.},

Yet, its performance is greatly variable and heavily depends on the choice of the stepsizes. This has motivated a large body of research on adaptive stepsizes. However, there is currently a gap in our theoretical understanding of these methods, especially in the non-convex setting. In this paper, we start closing this gap: we theoretically analyze in the convex and non-convex settings a generalized version of the AdaGrad stepsizes. We show sufficient conditions for these stepsizes to achieve almost sure asymptotic convergence of the gradients to zero, proving the first guarantee for generalized AdaGrad stepsizes in the non-convex setting. Moreover, we show that these stepsizes allow to automatically adapt to the level of noise of the stochastic gradients in both the convex and non-convex settings, interpolating between O(1/T) and O(1/sqrt(T)), up to logarithmic terms.},

Barring additional terms that arise due to the adaptivity of the monotonically nonincreasing merit parameter sequence, the proved complexity bound is comparable to that known for the stochastic gradient algorithm for unconstrained nonconvex optimization. The overall complexity bound, which accounts for the adaptivity of the merit parameter sequence, shows that a result comparable to the unconstrained setting (with additional logarithmic factors) holds with high probability.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-dimensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

  abstract      = {Stochastic gradient-based optimization methods, such as L-SVRG and its accelerated variant L-Katyusha [12], are widely used to train machine learning models. Theoretical and empirical performance of L-SVRG and L-Katyusha can be improved by sampling the observations from a non-uniform distribution [17]. However, to design a desired sampling distribution, Qian et al.[17] rely on prior knowledge of smoothness constants that can be computationally intractable to obtain in practice when the dimension of the model parameter is high. We propose an adaptive sampling strategy for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha that learns the sampling distribution with little computational overhead, while allowing it to change with iterates, and at the same time does not require any prior knowledge on the problem parameters. We prove convergence guarantees for L-SVRG and L-Katyusha for convex objectives when the sampling distribution changes with iterates. These results show that even without prior information, the proposed adaptive sampling strategy matches, and in some cases even surpasses, the performance of the sampling scheme in Qian et al.[17]. Extensive simulations support our theory and the practical utility of the proposed sampling scheme on real data.},

  abstract      = {Dynamic mechanism design has garnered significant attention from both computer scientists and economists in recent years. By allowing agents to interact with the seller over multiple rounds, where agents’ reward functions may change with time and are state-dependent, the framework is able to model a rich class of real-world problems. In these works, the interaction between agents and sellers is often assumed to follow a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We focus on the setting where the reward and transition functions of such an MDP are not known a priori, and we are attempting to recover the optimal mechanism using an a priori collected data set. In the setting where the function approximation is employed to handle large state spaces, with only mild assumptions on the expressiveness of the function class, we are able to design a dynamic mechanism using offline reinforcement learning algorithms. Moreover, learned mechanisms approximately have three key desiderata: efficiency, individual rationality, and truthfulness. Our algorithm is based on the pessimism principle and only requires a mild assumption on the coverage of the offline data set. To the best of our knowledge, our work provides the first offline RL algorithm for dynamic mechanism design without assuming uniform coverage.},

An intuitive approach would be to regularize the parameters so that users in the same cluster share similar model weights. The distances between the clusters can then be regularized to reflect the similarity between different clusters of users. We develop an algorithm that allows each cluster to communicate independently and derive the convergence results. We study a hierarchical linear model to theoretically demonstrate that our approach outperforms agents learning independently and agents learning a single shared weight. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.},

Thus, we provide a test and methodology for partial goodness of fit. The test is based on comparing a novel higher-order least squares principle with ordinary least squares.

Knowing the sparsity of such a graphical model is valuable for modeling multivariate distributions and for efficiently performing inference. While the problem of learning graph structure from data has been studied extensively for certain parametric families of distributions, most existing methods fail to consistently recover the graph structure for non-Gaussian data. Here we propose an algorithm for learning the Markov structure of continuous and non-Gaussian distributions. To characterize conditional independence, we introduce a score based on integrated Hessian information from the joint log-density, and we prove that this score upper bounds the conditional mutual information for a general class of distributions. To compute the score, our algorithm SING estimates the density using a deterministic coupling, induced by a triangular transport map, and iteratively exploits sparse structure in the map to reveal sparsity in the graph. For certain non-Gaussian datasets, we show that our algorithm recovers the graph structure even with a biased approximation to the density. Among other examples, we apply sing to learn the dependencies between the states of a chaotic dynamical system with local interactions.},

In contrast to the existing literature focused on approaches that encourage agents to explore over a diverse set of policies, we show that using a single policy to guide exploration across all agents is sufficient to obtain an almost-linear speedup in all cases compared to their fully sequential counterpart. Further, we show that this simple procedure is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors in the reward-free setting for both linear MDPs and two-player zero-sum MGs. From a practical perspective, our paper shows that a single policy is sufficient and provably optimal for incorporating parallelism during the exploration phase.},

  abstract     = {Graphical continuous Lyapunov models offer a new perspective on modeling causally interpretable dependence structure in multivariate data by treating each independent observation as a one-time cross-sectional snapshot of a temporal process. Specifically, the models assume the observations to be cross-sections of independent multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes in equilibrium. The Gaussian equilibrium exists under a stability assumption on the drift matrix, and the equilibrium covariance matrix is determined by the continuous Lyapunov equation. Each graphical continuous Lyapunov model assumes the drift matrix to be sparse with a support determined by a directed graph. A natural approach to model selection in this setting is to use an $\ell_1$-regularization approach that seeks to find a sparse approximate solution to the Lyapunov equation when given a sample covariance matrix. We study the model selection properties of the resulting lasso technique by applying the primal-dual witness technique for support recovery. Our analysis uses special spectral properties of the Hessian of the considered loss function in order to arrive at a consistency result. While the lasso technique is able to recover useful structure, our results also demonstrate that the relevant irrepresentability condition may be violated in subtle ways, preventing perfect recovery even in seemingly favorable settings.},

We study a system of interconnected agents over a graph and a distributed controller, called $\kappa$-distributed control, which lets the agents make control decisions based on the state information within distance $\kappa$ on the underlying graph. This controller can tune its degree of decentralization using the parameter $\kappa$ and thus allows a characterization of the relationship between decentralization and performance. We show that under mild assumptions, including stabilizability, detectability, and a subexponentially growing graph condition, the performance difference between $\kappa$-distributed control and centralized optimal control becomes exponentially small in $\kappa$. This result reveals that distributed control can achieve near-optimal performance with a moderate degree of decentralization, and thus it is an effective controller architecture for large-scale networked systems.},

Expected spectrum error bound is obtained for both the estimators. A general large deviation bound for the maximum spectral error of a collection of submatrices of a given dimension is also established. These results prove that when both the number of variables and sample size are large, the spectral error of the nonparametric estimators is of no greater order than that of the latent sample covariance matrix, at least when compared with some of the sharpest known error bounds for the later. As an application, we establish the minimax optimal convergence rate in the estimation of high-dimensional bandable correlation matrices via tapering off of these nonparametric estimators. An optimal convergence rate for sparse principal component analysis is also established as another example of possible applications of the main results.},

  abstract     = {Joint multimodal functional data acquisition, where functional data from multiple modes are measured simultaneously from the same subject, has emerged as an exciting modern approach enabled by recent engineering breakthroughs in the neurological and biological sciences. One prominent motivation to acquire such data is to enable new discoveries of the underlying connectivity by combining multimodal signals. Despite the scientific interest, there remains a gap in principled statistical methods for estimating the graph underlying multimodal functional data. To this end, we propose a new integrative framework that models the data generation process and identifies operators mapping from the observation space to the latent space. We then develop an estimator that simultaneously estimates the transformation operators and the latent graph. This estimator is based on the partial correlation operator, which we rigorously extend from the multivariate to the functional setting. Our procedure is provably efficient, with the estimator converging to a stationary point with quantifiable statistical error. Furthermore, we show recovery of the latent graph under mild conditions. Our work is applied to analyze simultaneously acquired multimodal brain imaging data where the graph indicates functional connectivity of the brain. We present simulation and empirical results that support the benefits of joint estimation.},

  abstract    = {We study online convex optimization with constraints consisting of multiple functional constraints and a relatively simple constraint set, such as a Euclidean ball. As enforcing the constraints at each time step through projections is computationally challenging in general, we allow decisions to violate the functional constraints but aim to achieve a low regret and cumulative violation of the constraints over a horizon of $T$ time steps. First-order methods achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constraint violation, which is the best-known bound, but do not take into account the structural information of the problem. Furthermore, the existing algorithms and analysis are limited to Euclidean space. In this paper, we provide an \emph{instance-dependent} bound for online convex optimization with complex constraints obtained by a novel online primal-dual mirror-prox algorithm. Our instance-dependent regret is quantified by the total gradient variation $V_*(T)$ in the sequence of loss functions. The proposed algorithm works in \emph{general} non-Euclidean spaces and simultaneously achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_*(T)})$ regret and an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constraint violation, which is never worse than the best-known $( \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T}), \mathcal{O}(1) )$ result and improves over previous works that applied mirror-prox-type algorithms for this problem achieving $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret and constraint violation. Finally, our algorithm is computationally efficient, as it only performs mirror descent steps in each iteration instead of solving a general Lagrangian minimization problem.},

  abstract     = {We propose a trust-region stochastic sequential quadratic programming algorithm (TR-StoSQP) to solve nonlinear optimization problems with stochastic objectives and deterministic equality constraints. We consider a fully stochastic setting, where in each iteration a single sample is generated to estimate the objective gradient. The algorithm adaptively selects the trust-region radius and, compared to the existing line-search StoSQP schemes, allows us to employ indefinite Hessian matrices (i.e., Hessians without modification) in SQP subproblems. As a trust-region method for constrained optimization, our algorithm needs to address an infeasibility issue -- the linearized equality constraints and trust-region constraints might lead to infeasible SQP subproblems. In this regard, we propose an \textit{adaptive relaxation technique} to compute the trial step that consists of a normal step and a tangential step. To control the lengths of the two steps, we adaptively decompose the trust-region radius into two segments based on the proportions of the feasibility and optimality residuals to the full KKT residual. The normal step has a closed form, while the tangential step is solved from a trust-region subproblem, to which a solution ensuring the Cauchy reduction is sufficient for our study. We establish the global almost sure convergence guarantee for TR-StoSQP, and illustrate its empirical performance on both a subset of problems in the CUTEst test set and constrained logistic regression problems using data from the LIBSVM collection.},

Our proposed test instead allows the associations among the random variables to be nonlinear and the data to be time-dependent. We build the test based on some highly flexible neural networks learners. We establish the asymptotic guarantees of the test, while allowing either the number of subjects or the number of time points for each subject to diverge to infinity.
